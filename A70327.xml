            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE EPISTLE.</head>
            <p>BRethren, my hearts desire and Prayer to God is, that you might be Sav'd, I long after you all in the Bowels of Jesus Christ, but I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my Heart, being jealous over you with a Godly jealously, fearing least by any means, as the Serpent beguil d <hi>Eve</hi> through his subtilty, you should be corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the simplicity that is in Christ. I am sensible of my great neglect and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulness, as to my great work and the good of Souls; and finding some decays and loud warnings, and knocks of <hi>Death</hi> to tell me, that this Earthly Tabernacle must shortly lye down in the dust, and that I am not like to amend what I have done amiss, to preach more powerfully, pray more heartily, and deal more faithfully than I have; I was willing to send abroad
<pb facs="tcp:94151:3"/> those few Lines, expressing my sense of the great danger the most are in by the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of themselves. I wish that such got on good by many worthy labourers amongst them for many years, may now reap real benefit by this ensuing Discourse. I had many thoughts about it, whether I should send it drest up in an exact modish way, Methodically and Elaborately order'd, and neatly worded; But finding care about That loseth the Heart, Life, and power of Truths; I was resolv'd to let it run natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, as coming, I hope, from the very bottom of my Heart, searching as deep as possibly I could, into real and sound Truth, that it might reach to the bottom of your Hearts, and do you real good.</p>
            <p>I confess, I have been too much pleas'd with Elegant and Eloquent Sermons, with Exact, Ingenious, and Elaborate Treatises. But of late, I find, the Wit, the Method, the Language, eat up the Heart and substance of the Truth. I can't observe such exactness this way in Holy Writ; but Ministers labour much to force such coherences and dependencies, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles and others never intended. Besides, the Truths are in themselves choice Jewels,
<pb facs="tcp:94151:3"/> and all painting, though never so rich and gaudy, takes off from the lustre and shining splendour of the glittering Pearl. Methinks, the most, I had almost said the best, do but trifle about the great things of God and Heaven: I am willing now to tell you plainly without Circumlocutions, and many Apologies, that it's high time for you to consider, whether you shall shortly be in Heaven or Hell, and to let you know that you are too negligent of looking to your selves; and whilst you seek,<note place="margin">Ne te quaesiveris extra.</note> and think to save your selves, you are really losing your selves to all Eternity. Could I but stop one Sinner in the way to Hell, and save one Soul out of this dangerous snare of <hi>Self-Neglect,</hi> and <hi>Self-Deceit,</hi> and <hi>Self-Undoing,</hi> I should not be-grudge my pains, nor value the censures and scorns of the proudest or wisest, let them be many or few. I have too much regarded the Frowns and Smiles of Men, which hath done me much hurt, and made me unfaithful; I thank God, I hope I can say, I am above it, far beyond it. Let the World despise, condemn, if God will but love, and say, well done, it's enough, I am satisfied.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:94151:4"/>
            <p>My main design and business is this, to convince the World, that most are decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and destroying themselves, and are not sensible of it, nor will be convinc'd of their great folly and wretched madness herein. You would take it kindly of a Physician, that would warn and help you against a dangerous disease, or a Lawyer that would give advice about your Estate; and why should you not kindly receive Counsel about your Souls? I hope some will read it, not with a critical censorious eye, but with a resolution to search and find out, whether there be any thing in it, that nearly concerns them, and may be of great use and good to them. How should I rejoyce before I die, could I hear of any one Soul brought out of the broad way of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, into the narrow path of Life by it. I am so sensible of mine own dreadful neglects and trifling, and obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the most very indifferent and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd about their Spiritual and Eternal Estate; it made me write with the more warmth and heat. You can't blame a Man that strives to stop the Fire in your House, if he cries Fire aloud, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly, and tramples on your Garden and
<pb facs="tcp:94151:4"/> Flowers. It's not time to Complement, or scarce to be civil. You will snatch Poyson, a Knife, or a Firebrand from a Child that is like to hurt himself, without ceremonies or persuasions, you will catch your Child violently out of the Fire, without using Intreaties. Knowing the terrour of the Lord, says the Apostle, we persuade Men we value not whether we are accounted mad Men, or sober; it's for your sakes,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.</note> and Christs love constrains us. This shews not wrath, or cruelty, or severity, but the greatest tenderness, pity, and compassion. The more loving and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate the Mother, the more earnest for her Childs good in case of danger. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, I not only forsee your ghastly looks, and hear your screetches and groans on your death-beds; not only see your Skull and Bones, and loathsom clammy dust in the Grave, but hear and see your dreadful cries, trembling and confusion at the great day, and your roarings and yellowings in Hell; and at present I see you busie and careful about trifles, and wearying your selves with very Vanity; some Laugh, others Weep; some Sing and
<pb facs="tcp:94151:5"/> Roar, others Sweat and Labour; Some fear great Troubles, others expect great Prosperity; and all trifling away your time about nothing, when Great, and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and blessed things, stand before you, are nigh you, and may be obtain'd; and therefore blame me not, if I am very earnest and importunate. It's but a very little while before you and I shall lye down in the Grave. We can't always eat, and drink, and sleep, as now we do, great changes are coming upon us, and yet we can't be wise and prepare. It was not iong since, there was no knowledge nor thought of us, and in a little while we shall be here no more; poor Worms creep out of the Earth, crawl about a little while, and into the Earth again, some sooner, some later; if we are wise we may mount up to Glory, which is the design of this Treatise.</p>
            <p>Were it Gods way, and what would prevail, I could cast dust on my head, rend my Clothes, and fall down at your doors, and with bended knees earnestly beg you to take care of your precious im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Souls, to flie from the wrath to come, and strive and run to get to Glory.
<pb facs="tcp:94151:5"/> I could beg you with loud cries, till my Throat were scorcht, and my Voice spent, and with Tears of Blood beseech you. I am sure, Gods people of old, his blessed Ministers especially, were strangely, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate; how earnest the Apostle, <hi>I beseech you, Brethren, by the Mercies of God, and in the Bowels of Jesus Christ; if there be any consolation in Christ, if any Bowels of Mercy,</hi> &amp;c. Never a Prisoner beg'd more earnestly for his own Life, than good <hi>Paul</hi> begs their Lives and Souls. But when we have done all, neither is he that Planteth any thing, or he that Watereth, though it be <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Appollo's, 1 Cor. 6.3.7.</hi> but God that giveth the Increase. Who is sufficient for this work? not Men nor Angels. It's the same power, that made Heaven and Earth, that can rule the raging Seas, and overthrow Mountains, that can change those Hearts of ours. If Means, or Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, or Judgements, would have wrought upon us, and done us good, we had been other manner of persons long agoe. Christ's Preaching, Company, holy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse, sweet and gracious Temper, won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Miracles, did not work on <hi>Judas;</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:94151:6"/> all the judgements not change <hi>Pharaoh</hi> nor his people; all the <hi>Israelites</hi> mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Deliverances, wonderful Protection, and Provision, nor Gods distinguishing kindness, did not work on the <hi>Israelites;</hi> but murmur,<note place="margin">Isa. 5.3.</note> repine, and inclin'd to Idolatry; God says, What could I have done more? what choice Preaching and Praying; what Heavenly Sacraments and Fasts; what excellent good Books have been in this Nation; and yet many, very many, as ignorant, prophane, filthy, and worldly, as if they had liv'd in the dark corners of the World? How many Sermons Preach'd against Pride, Wantonness, Covetousness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> pressing to prayer in Families and Closets? and yet not move one, scarce, in a Congregation, to one duty, or make them leave one sin. I have often been quite discourag'd in my Work, sinking under the burden, and apt to think, Lord, why should I offer Christ, Grace, and Glory, to these sinners any more, that will scarce hearken to what I say, and if they do, will leave all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them, and turn to the World and Vanity,<note place="margin">Isa. 6.9, 10, 11.</note> and there be alive, and at home. That such an Evangelical Prophet as
<pb facs="tcp:94151:6"/>
               <hi>Isaiah</hi> should be sent to make the Hearts of the people fat, and their ears heavy, and shut their eyes. One would think, that was work for false Prophets and blind Priests. But will not much and often Teaching prevail? No, quite contrary, the word was unto them,<note place="margin">Chap. 28.13.</note> precept upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, and there a little; that they might go and fall backward and be broken, snared, and taken. So that I am often thinking, we must turn off from the people more to God, and say, Lord, open these peoples eyes, ears, and hearts; I must pray, and You too, that God may bless these Lines to your Souls, and then may they do you real good.</p>
            <p>But since our great Lord and Master bears and forbears, intreats and wooes; and since Christ is meek and lowly, kind and pitiful; I cannot but intreat and beseech you once more, that you would consider the things that belong to your peace, prize and receive them, before they are hid from your eyes; I cannot but beg you for Gods sake, who hath no pleasure in your death, had rather you
<pb facs="tcp:94151:7"/> would turn and live; for Christ's sake, who would see of the travel of his Soul, and be satisfied, who died bitterly to save you.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.20.</note> Says the Apostle, as though God did beseech you by us, we pray you in Christ's stead; for the Gospels sake, so full of Mercy and Goodness; for your own Souls sake, so poor, and empty, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable, that needs all this Mercy, and will be made blessed by it. Let me beg you to consider your selves, is all well at present with you? if so, you have cause to bless God and be thankful; but if not, can you live and die so? You may slight such a Messenger as I am, and reject my Counsel, but God will send another Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger shortly, you cannot resist, nor reject, the Call and Summons of Death. It is easie to cast this book behind you, or read it carelesly, or despise and laugh at this warning. This may be the last Call to some of you; God will not much longer trouble or burden you with these things; his Mercy will not wait, nor his Spirit strive in this manner. Hear ye the Lord speaking to you, as the Apostle, <hi>1 Cor. 4.18.</hi> to <hi>21.</hi> Some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you,
<pb facs="tcp:94151:7"/> but I will come to you shortly; and the Lord will know not the Speech of them that are puffed up, as if they were something, when they are nothing, and deceive themselves; but the Power, Truth, and Life of Godliness, for the Kingdom of God is not in word, but in power. What will you, shall I come to you with the Rod of anger and destruction, or in love to Save and Exalt you? Think seriously how it 'twil be; Christ will come in flaming fire against some, and to be glorified in some, and admired. On what hand are you like to be found? Do you really look, long for, or love the appearing of Jesus Christ, or do you dread it? Are you ready, watching, praying, preparing, blessed art thou, such a Servant, Whom the Lord, when he comes, shall find so doing. I can but persuade and intreat you, I can't force and command you. God seems to be as one gone into a far Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and lets the World alone to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; hath only appointed all their works and the Porters, the Ministers,<note place="margin">Mark. 13.34.</note> are to warn and call upon you. You may now hear or refuse, pray in your Families, or not pray; swear, or not swear; persecute or
<pb facs="tcp:94151:8"/> suffer; God lets Men alone at the present, only persuades you to be wise; ay, but God will come and call over all, and call all to account;<note place="margin">Luke 19.13, 15, 16, 17.

It's said, he went into a far Country for a long time, that is, it seems so to us, that the wicked Servant says, the Lord delays his coming, and falls to oppression and drunkenness; God will come in an hour when he thinks not,<note place="margin">Ch. 17, 27.28.</note> and woe be unto him. As it was in the days of <hi>Noah,</hi> they did eat, they drank, they Married Wives, until the day; in the days of <hi>Lot,</hi> they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded, till the same day that it rain'd Fire and Brimstone from Heaven, and destroyed them all, so is the coming of the Son of Man. Thus, most Men are taken by Death in the midst of business. Most Men are buying and selling, full of cares, and fears, and hopes, and joys, till Death strikes them down, and all is gone. Many have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd much for another year, about their Houses, their Grounds, their Children, and Death says this Night, or this Week, thou must be gone to another place, about
<pb facs="tcp:94151:8"/> other matters. The Sinner is amaz'd, quite confounded, and overwhelm'd, as if he never heard of it. The good Man says, welcom Death, and welcom Christ, and welcom Heaven; when Death says, I must take away all; he says, I am ready to be stript; it's no more than I look'd and prepar'd for. Good Mr. <hi>Jordan</hi> that had assurance of Gods love Forty years, said, he would go forth some miles to meet Death, as the best Messenger he ever saw: Another chearfully let his Soul out of his Body, and said, now Angels do your work. This is my great end in writing this Book, to persuade you so to take care of your selves; that when Friends shall weep over you dying, and leave you gasping out your last, and dead, your Souls may go with Triumph and glory, to better Friends, to mount <hi>Sion,</hi> to the City of the living God, the Heavenly <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and to God the judge of all, and to the spirits of just Men made perfect; and to <hi>Jesus</hi> the Mediator of the new Covenant, and to the blood of sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, that speaketh better things than the blood of <hi>Abel.</hi> That spoke wrath, death, and vengeance; this speaks Mercy,
<pb facs="tcp:94151:9"/> Life, and Eternal Glory. The Lord grant, if it be his blessed will, that these following Lines may be so read, believ'd, and practis'd, that you may be thus happy, and eternally sav'd. I leave and commend both You, and the work, to the blessing of the great God above, who alone can make it really good to your Souls.</p>

Now, because there are so few of these (though most, all seek them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, yet they are generally deceiv'd about themselves, and what is really good for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves) I was willing to Treat of this weighty, searching and awakening Subject, to perswade all men to look to themselves; If self, that Soul and Body of thine be lost to all Eternity, what is all the World to thee? what though Hundreds and Thousands about thee flourish and prosper,<note place="margin">

Certainly, nothing can be more acceptable, (if rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood) than good Counsel to perswade men to be truly wise, honourable, great, rich, and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally happy. But the most mistake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and their own real good: They take the Sensual, Carnal, Wordly, Bodily self to be the main, their all; hence all their Care, Thoughts, Fears, Hopes, Joyes, and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows are about this false self; and so they are deluded and lost; and thus mistaking self,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:94151:10"/> they are deceiv'd about other matters; taking that to be truly good, and only good that gratifies and pleaseth this sinfull, sensual self; so their great care is what to Eat, and what to Drink, and what to put on; and choose and seek after the most, the best of those lower thing; and daily, and foolishly neglect their Souls, their main, their only self, and the great and good things that conduce to the happiness, and Eternal welfare of the Soul. Therefore,<note place="margin">

               <p>This may have respect to,</p>

               <p n="1">1. What it is for a Man to think himself to be something?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. in general. It is for a Man to have great and high thoughts of himself: As it is said of <hi>Theudas, Acts</hi> 5.36. boasting [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] saying, speaking out him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be some extraordinary considerable Person: And <hi>Simon Magnus, Acts</hi> 8.9. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, making himself some great Person: Yet <hi>Paul</hi> tells him after his pretended Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and Baptisme <hi>v.</hi> 21.22. what really he was, that his Heart was not right in the sight of God, and had neither Part nor Lot in that matter, nay, <hi>v.</hi> 23. tells him he was so far from it, that he was in the gall of bitterness and bond of iniquity: This denotes not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this to be in him, as his Original Sin, but some high degree of sin; and yet Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Writers tell us, that he was so eminent and admir'd amongst the People, that he was even ador'd as a God, and a Statue was set up for him in <hi>Rome,</hi> with this Inscription on it, <hi>To</hi> Simon <hi>the Holy God.</hi> Some write that he did labour to possess them that he was the <hi>Messias;</hi> the People cry him up strangely <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>To him they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is,</hi> not hath, <hi>but is the great Power of God.</hi> How far may men go, and dazle the Eyes of the World, and for a long time, <hi>v.</hi> 11. and yet be in a dangerous, desperate, damnable condition? Had we the extraordinary searching spirit of the Apostle,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:94151:14"/> might we not say so to many, may it not be said to many of us. <hi>Thou hast no part nor lot in this matter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 More particularly, according to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendment of the Text, it may respect one of these two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Degrees of Grace, Eminency and Growth: A man may think himself stronger and richer in Grace, than really he is, and consequently his Confidence may rise above his Strength; thus a Man thinking himself stronger, he may take too heavy a burden on him, or taller, may venture into deep Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to his prejudice and hurt.</p>
               <p>A Mans mistake in judging of the degrees and measure of his Grace, may betray him in three Instances.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It may embolden him to adventure upon such undertakings and employments, as are above his Abilities.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.18, 19, 20. compar'd with 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.7.</note> Thus many step out of their Callings and Places, as fancying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves born for higher and greater things. How many do in all Ages confidently thrust themselves into the ministry for a livelihood, and bold, and high, and conceited; when the Apostle says, <hi>Who is sufficient for those things?</hi> How many could answer confidently they are, at least in their own thoughts, though in the esteem of few others. <hi>David</hi> was of another temper, <hi>Psal.</hi> 131.1. <hi>Mine heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty, neither do I exercise my self in great matters, nor in things too high for me.</hi> But <hi>v.</hi> 2.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:94151:14"/> there is a great deal in that short Psalm, that many may be a long time learning by Heart, though easie by Head.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In adventuring upon Temptations and occasions of sin. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Confidence carried him to the High Priests Hall,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mark</hi> 14.29, 30, 31.</note> and there he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied Christ. In such Cases a Man should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider his own Strength, and especially God's Call and Conduct. When good men fall into Sin, it's usually either from remissness, when a Spirit of Slumber seaseth on them, or from carnal confidence, presuming beyond their attainments. We pray <hi>lead us not into tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and yet lead our selves into them.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) In bearing the Cross. Here also one may conceit his Strength more than he finds it in a Tryal.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>John</hi> 13.36, 37.</note>
                  <hi>Peter</hi> thought himself stronger than he was; <hi>though all forsake, yet not I, I will dye with, and for thee;</hi> and so threw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self into the Seas, had not his Saviour been there and help'd, he had Perish'd.

Not but that Gods Ordinances are of great worth in themselves, and a real blessing to them that rightly receive them; but to others that are wicked, and continue in their sins, its just nothing.

Thus all Nations compar'd with God,<note place="margin">

               <p n="2">2. But he that thinks he hath true Grace,

I doubt not but there are many in Hell, that did resolve on Earth to repent and turn before they dye, and go to Heaven; or else these Sinners promise themselves Peace, Security and Happiness, though they go on in their sins, and live and dye as they are.

               <p n="3">3. In baffling your own Souls. In all that is said before, in attempting to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose upon God, and cheating others, they do but wound and wrong themselves. <hi>He that sins against</hi> God doth <hi>but wrong his own Soul.</hi>

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:94151:21"/> heads, and fasten their envenom'd Poyson'd tops into their own Hearts. But these do industriously, immediately, and directly set themselves against themselves; flatter and cry peace to their Souls in a way of sin, when God, nor the Word, when their Lives nor their Consciences speak not Peace: Yet will these say, Soul take thine ease, Eat, Drink and be Merry, all is well. Those Souls, if they should be heard cry for Bread, Bread of Life, these give them neither Bread, nor what will satisfie; nay, give them Stones, and Poyson, and Scorpions. Say, why dost thou complain, thou art Rich and needest nothing, when the Soul, says, this I need the more; I need Pardon, Prayer, Repentance, Faith; Christ nor Soul I am not at leasure to hearken to thy Call and Cravings; I have a Body that craves, and gripes and pinches, if I labour not, and get Bread, and this work and way I like; but I like not the way nor the work, wherein I must get Nourishment for thee. I will Hear and Read, and Pray some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, if some shells and shadows will satisfie my longings; but I can't set to such serious, solemn, Heart-searching Work; the Carnal Mind cannot please God,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7.</note> nor God his ways please it. Be quiet, and still, I shall have Peace though I walk in this course of Sin.</p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:94151:21"/>
               <p>Secondly, by self-deceving Mediums cheat themselves. We know that the figure or colour of the Object may be mis-repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented through the unfitness of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium. A strait Stick put into the Water seems crooked, because of the inequality of the Medium. If we look through a Red or Green Glass, all things seem to be of the same Colour: Artificial Glasses Represent things bigger or less, more Beautiful or Deformed then they are in themselves. Many are deceived about their Spiritual Estate, by arming their Souls and their Actions, in lying, and delusive Glasses. <hi>E. Gr.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. There is the false Glass of self-Love. Self is the great Idol which every unsanctified person doth Worship, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.2, 3. usually all things are esteemed and judg'd as Love doth direct or incline. This is call'd Self-Love, but it's Self-Hatred; Men take the Sensual part for Self, which is not the true Self. This sinful Self must be denied, or true Self can't be sav'd: The great Contest is which shall prevail; most Men are for pleasing and indulging this Carnal Self in Honours, Pleasures, Sloth, Wantoness and Covetousness, Self-Love, deceives a Man four ways.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By hindring his Conviction, that he will not see the evil which is really in him, so he will not think himself to be nothing.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:94151:22"/>2. By Assuming and Arrogating to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self that good, which in truth doth not belong to him, and so he thinks himself, though falsely, to be something.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By contriving and pulling in all, to satisfie and please the sinfull and fleshly part.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And by crossing, denying and hindring what will promote the Spiritual and Eternal good.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) Self-Love will not permit a Man to believe that he is so bad, as indeed he is, will appear in Two Instances.</p>
               <p n="1">1. With respect to the inward frame of his Heart.</p>
               <p n="2">2. His outward Actions, which proceed from his corrupt Principle.</p>
               <p n="1">1. With respect to the inward Principle and Frame of his Heart unrenewed. It's impossible (until God take the Work into his hands,) to convince an unregenerate Person, that his Heart is bad by Nature, as the Scripture affirms it to be, That it hath no good in it. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.18. He thinks he hath many good Motions and Affections, that it's full of <hi>enmity against God</hi> and all that is good. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. He finds that he Loves God,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.5.</note> and loves much Good, though not all. All that can be said to convince them, will but enrage them, and they are incens'd against such suggestion. When <hi>Elisha</hi> told <hi>Hazael</hi> of his Barbarous and bloody Heart, he seems to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:94151:22"/> abhor it. 2 <hi>Kings,</hi> 8.12, 13. <hi>Is thy Servant a Dog,</hi> tell such things to Ravenous Beasts and Monsters; what! <hi>dash Children, rip up Women,</hi> God forbid; I doubt not but he spake them really as he thought. All the Prophet Answers; <hi>Thou shalt be King over</hi> Syria, <hi>thou shalt have Power, Provocation and Temptation, and then see what thy wicked Heart will do.</hi> I doubt not, should one have told <hi>Judas</hi> that he would betray his Master with a Kiss, sell his Lord for Thirty Pence, he would stoutly have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied it. <hi>Peter</hi> did not know how much Corruption was in his Nature left, that Sinned so fouly, and deny'd his Master so grosly, with Execrations and Damnings; but Christ knew before-hand. Little did <hi>David</hi> think whither a glance of his Eye would lead him to Adultery, Dissembling, Murder, lying in the Sin, some think near a Twelve-Month. How is it then with poor un-converted Sinners that have no Light to discern this evil? Now because they can't see this, they can't Repent, nor bewail, nor strive against it, and so are deceiv'd, and undone.</p>
               <p n="2">2. With respect to the outward actions, though notorious and gross, yet have Men slights and subterfuges to deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. <hi>E. Gr.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. By denying the Fact, though never so Guilty, known to themselves, if not to many abo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="2 letters">

                     <hi>Isa.</hi> 5.20.</note> as by calling things by other names as Good Evil, ay, and Evil Good, as calling Drunkenness good Fellowship, Idleness and Sloth, and unlawful Games, innocent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

What though <hi>Saul</hi> pleaded hard and earnestly, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. What good words, <hi>v.</hi> 13. <hi>Blessed art thou of the Lord, I have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd the commandment of the Lord.

               <p>Thirdly, by Extenuations. Gross Sins are shrunk into Venial Slips, Enormities must pass for Infirmities. As of <hi>Zoar,</hi> is it not a little one? and as <hi>Jonathan,</hi> I have tasted a little Honey, and must I dye? My Sins are not so many nor so great; besides my Temptations are such I can't help it; I have a bad Nature, apt to be passionate and froward, of an hot consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution and must Drink; I am weak and sick, and can't Work; I am unlearned, and can't Read and Pray; And thus many ways do all Sinners excuse, and lessen their Faults; and instead of Sorrow and Amendment, they plead for them, or not against them; they will cast the blame on others,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.</note> as <hi>Adam</hi> on <hi>Eve,</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> on the Devil, but for all that they both suffer'd deeply: Some cast it on the Muses; it's true, they may neglect to give warning and speak plainly, and your Blood may be requir'd of their hands; ay, but for all that you shall dye in your Sins.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3.18.</note> What shall be said or done to convince the most of this horrid gross self-undoing deceit? Many say, my Parents bred me not to Learning; had they not put you to work and Trade, would you therefore stand, and say, I will not Labour. Men are not so easily cheated about the matters of this
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:94151:24"/> World, and the things of this short frail Life.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Self-Love will perswade a Man to Arrogate to himself that good, which he hath no Title to, or to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie every thing beyond its due bounds, which hath the best appearance of good in him: You see what Love to Friends, Relations, any that are kind and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull to them, will make them speak for them, cry them up beyond their deserts, and beyond all what their Neighbours know; it may be they know much to the contrary: Thus the silly fond sinful Wretch fancies great matters, and admires him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self for little or nothing. <hi>E. Gr.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Man may think himself, a sound Christian, a sincere Convert, because he hath Read the Nature of true Conversion, because he knows there must be Faith, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, hatred of Sin, Love to God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but never considers how either of these appear to be in him. He mistakes the Picture and Counterfeit of Grace, for that which is real; as when a Man takes up false notions of Faith, yet he believes a God, so do the Devils, and tremble too; He believes Christ came into the World to save Sinners; so do many that never believe in him, that never Love him, cleave to him, depend upon him, submit to him as their dear Husband, Head and Saviour, as their King and Lord; nay
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:94151:25"/> Glory, and Boast of him: Thus many mistake Repentance, when 'tis very far from that. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.11. Shewing it self by those Gracious Effects working in them, that carefullness to please God, that clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring themselves of all Guilt, that Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against Sin and themselves for it, that fear of Sin, and of God, that vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment desire to please God, that Zeal for his Glory and against Evil, that Revenge against themselves; And thus approving themselves in all things true Penitents and sincere Converts: What small matters content the most, he may think the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal bodily Exercise in Religion to be enough; and because he finds Heart-work difficult, wholly rest in the bare performance of Duties, which profits little or nothing at all, without the power of Godliness, that bears down Sin, breaks thorow difficulties, and reaches up to Heaven. How many Glory and boast as the proud Pharisee of <hi>Fasts</hi> and <hi>Alms</hi> and <hi>good Works?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 18.11.</note> and yet all rejected. Many think, because they are Sober and Innocent, and hurt no body, though they hurt themselves continually, that all is well. Much might be said here to convince and undeceive, were it proper to this Head. Not only the Tree that brings forth bad Fruit, <hi>but the Tree that brings forth not good Fruit, must be hewn down, and cast into the Fire:</hi> Not only the Wicked Servant, that wasts his Masters
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:94151:25"/> Talent in Ryoting, and Drunkenness, and Excess, but the Servant that lays up his Talent in sloth and unprofitableness, is a wicked and sloathful Servant, and must as unprofitable, be cast into Hell. It's not enough, not only, not to Swear or Curse, or speak filthy or prophanely with my Tongue, but do I praise God with my Tongue, and speak to the edifying of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that the Ear which hears me, may bless me. So may I instance in all other Talents.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another false Glass. Men deceive themselves, when they view their Spiritual State through the Glass of other Mens Opinions of them. An Hypocrite applauds himself in the esteem which he finds with others; This the Text expresseth by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing in another. <hi>John</hi> 7.47, 48, 49. <hi>Have any of the Rulers or Pharisees believed in him?</hi> Ye are deceived, ye are Accursed. Thus Men readily pass Sentence according to the Noise and Applause of the world. Now this must needs be very false, at least a doubtful, and uncertain Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. How is it possible for others to know their Hearts; they hear their Words, see their Actions, and it may be not many of them, at lest them that conceal and hide the uncomely parts; you cover your De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formities, and appear in the best Dress to the World, and they know not your Desires,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:94151:26"/> your Aims, your Ends, your Down-lying, your Up-rising, what you Love or what you Eat. Sometimes they applaud you, for that God may abhor you. How plain is that to the Scribes and Pharisees, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.15. <hi>Ye are they which justifie, their selves amongst Men, but God knows their Hearts;</hi> for oftentimes, <hi>that which is highly esteem'd amongst Men, is an Abomination in the sight of God.</hi> That we may be thought great Devotion, Strictness and Severity, God may know and abhor for Pride and Hipocrisie.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A Third false Glass. When Men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare themselves with others whom they judge much worse. They are apt to conclude themselves truly and sufficiently good, because they are not so bad as some others: Thus the Pharisee, <hi>I am not such a Sinner;</hi> nor as the Publican. This seems directly intended in the Text, and intimated again, <hi>v.</hi> 4. Then shall he have rejoycing in himself, not meerly by comparing himself with others. It's a weak Argument for a Man to prove him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self good, because others are very bad. What Help or Relief is it to me, if they miscary, and I too; in Hell they shall be Hypocrites and unbelievers, as well as Drunkards and Theeves, and Murderers and Fornicators.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>John</hi> 7.48 49. <hi>Ch.</hi> 9.34.</note> The Pharisees rais'd the reputation of their Sanctity, by vilifying others. This swells Men with Pride, and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:94151:26"/> begets Censoriousness and Bitterness, and is so far from being a fruit of the Spirit,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.20, 21. <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.3, 4.</note> that it's apparently a work of the Flesh, and is a symptom of Hypocrisie. God never made other mens lives a rule for us to walk by, or try our selves by. The Apostle, so good a Man, advises them to be followers of him, no further than he followed Christ. This is the great, common, and dangerous snare. My Neighbours do no more, or not so much as I, I see the best of my Friends and Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance have their failings as well as I, and so had the Good Men in Scripture. I fear such and such are not right that I know, but I thank God it's not so with me. It may be they see and think as bad, in and of you, and please themselves.</p>
               <p>False Glass, when Men compare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with themselves,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.12.</note> and find that they have given over the practice of some sins, which they formerly walked in, and taken up the performance of some external exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises of Religion, which before they slighted or neglected, they upon this, conclude, that they are sound Christians; as when the Drunkard refrains his intemperate Cups, and prays in his Family, but Partial Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation is consistent with a state of Ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, as we see in <hi>Ahab,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 21.27. and <hi>Herod, Mark</hi> 6.20. Sin may be left when it's not mortfied, we may be weary of the World, before we are wean'd from it. Lust may shift from one extream to another, <hi>Rom.</hi>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:94151:27"/> 2.22. <hi>thou that abhorrest Idols, dost thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Sacriledge;</hi> some turn from one prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality, and excess to covetousness; others from a penurious scraping Life to extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies and spending. Some, their Lusts leave them as uncleanness and rioting, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they leave them. And yet how many deceive themselves with a little partial a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment without any real, thorow, and universal change.<note place="margin">a quatenus ad omne valet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequentia.</note> Do not hate sin as sin, and so hate every sin; as he that hates a Toad, as a Toad hates every Toad, the nearer it comes to him, to his bosom, the more start from and cry out against it. A Swine may be in a clean Pasture, yet the nature is not chang'd, but it gets to the Mire, and will wallow in it again. Where this real change is, its from a Lion to a Lamb, an heart of Stone made an heart of Flesh:<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9, 10.</note>
                  <hi>all old things are done away, and all things become new; such were some of you, but you are wasted, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justify'd in Christ and by the Spirit;</hi> clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed from all filthiness of Flesh and Spirit, and sanctify'd throughout in Body, Soul and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>
               <p n="3">3ly. Self-deceiving Conclusions, when Men put fallacies on themselves.</p>
               <p>This may be done two ways.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When the Proposition they lay down is true, but the assumption is false, or they draw inconsequent Inferences from true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, but still the conclusion is false.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:94151:27"/>2. When they build on false propositions, as if they were true.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When the Proposition is true, but the Assumption is false. <hi>e. gr.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He that believes shall be saved, John</hi> 3.18. <hi>Acts</hi> 16.31. and then assume, but I believe, and conclude therefore I shall be saved. The promise is most true, but many err in the application as to themselves, when they are really destitute of that saving lively working Faith, to which the promise is made, Now would Men take pains, to search what manner of Faith that is, which is sowing: A Faith that worketh by Love,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1.</note> a Faith that makes things absent really present; such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Christ as King, Priest and Prophet,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>John</hi> 1.12.</note> as your Head and Husband, as your Life and Salvation, as your All, and receive power to become the Sons of God; that is to Love, Honour and Fear God as your Father, and are made like unto him; and then on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand would they bring their Faith to this Touch-stone and Tryal, they might find it nothing so, but Presumpsion and Delusion. So for Prayer, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.13. <hi>Whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved;</hi> but I pray daily, therefore I shall be saved: But then search what Prayer it is that is well-pleasing to God, and God to the Soul. It must be sincere and fervent, and of the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, Pray and not faint, Pray with the whole heart, not regard iniquity in the heart. <hi>Jer.</hi> 29.12. <hi>Ye shall call and pray, and I will
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:94151:28"/> hearken;</hi> but mistake me not, it's not any kind of Praying. <hi>v.</hi> 13. <hi>Ye shall seek me and find me, when you shall search for me with all your heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. When Men lay down that for truth in the main Proposition, which is indeed false; and then the ground-work failing, whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is built upon it must needs fall. When Men make those Characters and Marks of Gods Children, which God made not so, nor will own. Thus Men thorow wilful igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, sloth, and inconsideration, will run themselves into destruction, say God and his word never so much, nor so plainly against it. Men are not so gross, as to declare, they will run to Hell, and not hearken to God; though some are so bold and impudent, as to declare against Gods Commands, and say they will not obey. Yet others are more modest and cunning, and will pretend somewhat for their sloth and sinfull condition, and hope, at least pretend, all will be well, though they scarce believe it themselves.</p>

Thus Sinners abuse Gods dealings every way, if they prosper and live long, then they presume and abuse his forbearance and bounty; if God strikes them and crosseth them, then they murmure or hope that's all, and it's as much as your sins deserve.

It's when afflictions do Men good, purge away their Sins, yield afterward the peaceable fruit of righteousness, that they prevent future wrath. A Righteous Man falls and riseth again, but the wicked fall into the miseries, as one falling down a Precipiece, or steep Hill, never stop till they come to the bottom of Hell.

               <p>THE proper means to rectifie mistake, and save our selves. Herein we may take notice of,</p>

               </p>

               </p>

                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> Set your heart on your ways.</note>
                  <hi>Proof.</hi> We have God's express Charge for it, <hi>Hag.</hi> 1.5, 7. <hi>Thus saith the Lord of Hosts,</hi> thus saith Jehovah, <hi>Consider your ways,</hi> and then helps them in this work, consider what your carriage hath been towards God, and what his dealings have been with you. Want of serious consideration is the grand cause that most miscarry; they will not be at leasure to sit down and think how 'tis with them, whither they are going, and whether God approves of what they are about, and will at last say, <hi>Well done good and faithful Servant.</hi> The Apostle useth many words, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Examine your selves whether you be in faith;</hi> alas! most doubt not of it, but they are; ay, <hi>but prove your own selves;</hi>

Not Christ's name on you, or Christ preached to you, or own'd by you enough, but Christ in you the hope of Glory; or else you are <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> not approv'd of God, Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, cast away.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Persons <hi>[every man]</hi> of what rank or condition soever he be. <hi>Magus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.3, 4. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.17. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.15, 16.</note> must prove your own work, and <hi>Minus</hi> their own works, so must Parents, Children, Masters, and Servants. Each must mind their Places and Relations, and all their respective Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
               <p>But especially every man must prove his own work with respect to his Spiritual State, whether his work be such as is from a sound good Heart or no; whether he be in a saving condition, whether he is like to be sav'd or lost for ever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reasons.</hi> 1. Every Man is prone to deceive himself, every Man hurts and wounds him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and is like to destroy himself; all the Devils in Hell and Men on Earth could not do this, if we did not help on; now its fit the Remedy should extend as far as the Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, good and bad are apt to be mistaken, good men mistake and miscarry much, Bad men to all Eternity. This is Epidemical, an Universal disease. Some are wise for one thing, some skilful in other matters; some neglect their Shops, others their Cattle, some
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:94151:32"/> regardless about their Cloaths, many hurt their Friends, but all herein agree, in being apt to delude their Souls. This runs thorow all Mankind; Wise-men, Learned-Men, Stout-men, Poor-men, Trades-men, all sorts are busie in deceiving themselves.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Every Man must do this for himself, or none can; others may perswade to it, give Arguments, Counsels, lay down Rules, but each Man must do this for himself. The greatest Lord and Prince, the most dainty tender Lady, such as have all other things done for you, your Houses built, their Meat provided, their work in Field and House done by others, must do this each for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; or they are undone. Others cannot love God for us, hate Sin for us, believe in Christ for us, do good Works for us, no more then they can eat and drink for us, and we live by it, and get nourishment from it. The Master and Servant, the Mistress and Hand-maid must each pray for themselves, mortify their own Lusts; as they cannot do it for us, neither can they know how we do it, whether in sincerity, or Hypocrisie. We may be proud or filthy, or prophane in our thoughts, in splendid duties, who knows our Hearts? Who calls us to an account when we lie down, what we have done all the day, therefore had we great need to look to our selves.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Every one must give account to God himself, and for himself; who can answer
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:94151:32"/> for each other at that great and terrible day. You see every person is singled out by Death, here one, and there another. No company call'd to assist or Answer; a whole Family or Town layes a single Corps into the Grave, and all go each to their Houses, and the naked Soul appears alone before God's Tribunal to give an account. Every Man must dye for himself: <hi>David</hi> cries out, <hi>O</hi> Absolom, <hi>my Son, my Son, would God I had died for thee.</hi> No, <hi>David,</hi> no, that young Gallant must go himself, and answer for himself.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Every Man must <hi>have rejoycing in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,</hi> or <hi>bear his own burden.</hi> Every one must go to Heaven or Hell for himself; I shall be undone or sav'd my self, and therefore it's fit I should try my own work.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The matter or thing prescrib'd, and therein,</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) The Act <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> the word imports many things.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) To discern,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.56.</note>
                  <hi>i. e.</hi> upon former obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to make a probable canjecture. How is it that you do not discern this time <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> cannot you guess that this time is near? Though we cannot fully know our hearts and wayes; yet if we are wise and watchful, we may give a shrewd guess. We do but guess at the distempers of our Body, and throw in Physick at all adventures sometimes, but we are sure of what is good for our Souls, and we may
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:94151:33"/> find out the Distemper, and the Cure. A Man that's running behind-hand in his Trade may soon guess it. But if men will never cast up their Accounts, looks over their Shops, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then are they cast into Prison e're they are aware of it; as many are into the Grave, into Hell, and will cast up nor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To prove by Trial or experience, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.19. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. The Oxen, <hi>I go to prove them, i.e.</hi> make an experiment whether they will work or no. Thus should <hi>I go to prove them, i.e.</hi> make an experiment whether they will work or no. Thus should we try our Prayers by praying earnestly, try our Faith by the exercise of it. It's a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed thing to have the sweetness of Love in loving God; to have the comfort, and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and satisfaction of Humility and Meekness and Patience, in the use and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of them? it's much more than all we read or hear of it. What is it for me to read of <hi>Abraham's</hi> offering up his Son <hi>Isaac,</hi> of <hi>Job's</hi> Patience, of <hi>David</hi>'s Prayers and Praises, and high exaltations of God and his word, unless I have those Graces, and can read the same Psalms, with the same Spirit and Heart. <hi>David</hi> is gone to Heaven, this is left for me, not barely to read, as Children their lesson, but breathe out my Soul, in, and with them. Can I say, <hi>As the Hart,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ps.</hi> 42.1.</note> &amp;c. So, not only <hi>David</hi>'s Soul did, but my Soul now doth thirst after God,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:94151:33"/> the living God, and so the 119 <hi>Psal.</hi> Why should you not endeavour to read it all over as the Psalm. Or that my ways were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, and my Soul breaketh; or how I love thy Law. Would you prove your Hearts, your Tongues, your Lives, your Graces, your Duties, try them by use and exercise; see what you can do at the work of God. Many sad and dejected are still looking back for evidences; do you fear your want of Love, love God and Christ presently.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1.</note> The Apostle seems to be actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally exercising Grace in the presence of God; we are justified, have peace, have access, we now stand, and now rejoyce, and as to troubles,<note place="margin">

               <p n="3">3.<note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.10. <gap reason="foreign">

Thus Candidates of the Ministry are first to be proved, and such need to be qualified for the work with Gifts, and should consider their own Abilities, natural or acquir'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they be tryed by others. So we that hope for Heaven, should try our State and Work, before we appear before Gods search and tryal.</p>
               <p>We should put searching questions to our selves, have I competent knowledge, have I done my Master's work on earth. Am
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:94151:34"/> I now ready to dye, can I upon good grounds rejoyce in hope of Glory. If you would search and judge your selves, you should not be judged, at least not condemned by the Lord. Pass a right Judgment on your selves; say not all is well, when it is not so.</p>
               <p>The result of these Three Heads is this, He that would wisely, faithfully, and for his own good, prove his own work, he must, 1. Wisely observe. 2. Make experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and 3. Truly pass a Judgement on it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The word, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Having tasted now the result and moral of all this consists in,</p>
               <p n="1">1. A sincere impartial trial upon enquiry, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.40. <hi>Let us search, and try our ways.</hi> This calls for serious consideration from resolution and hearty endeavours, to find out how 'tis with our Spiritual State; not put it off slightly, but labour to search to the bottom. Could Men be brought to this once, there were some hopes. Some slight superficial Enquiries you make, but not go to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom; not as by Fire, not bring all to the Touch-stone of Gods Word; not roll and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:94151:35"/> chew it, till tast whether it be bitter or sweet.</p>
               <p n="2">2. An upright passing of Judgment accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Truth, when you find it dross and trash, let the fire consume it; throw what is filth and rotten to the dunghill. Say, thus I am, and thus I do, I am undone; I am not sound, all is out of order. Say (as <hi>Paul</hi> to another) <hi>My Heart is not right with God, I am in the gall of bitterness and bond of Iniquity;</hi> and set it home, till you feel it sink under it: Weep and refuse to be comforted. Say, what is all the World to me, when I am perishing, falling into Hell.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A judicious allowance upon good Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.14. <hi>I know and am perswaded by the Lord Jesus, that it's not unclean:</hi> When I find I am indeed in the way of God, to hold on, and hold out, and not stagger; stand to it and own the fault, whosoever speaks against it.

               <p n="1">1. To God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4, 5. I value not Mans judgement, he that judgeth me is the Lord. How often do good Men appeal to God? <hi>David Psal.</hi> 26. <hi>begin. Judge me O Lord; thou knowest thy Servant.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 17.18.</note> O Blessed comfortable appeal: So did <hi>Jerimiah, Chr.</hi> 12.3. So <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah, Remember Lord how I have walked; Thou knowest,</hi> said <hi>Peter, that I love thee.</hi> How often
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:94151:35"/> do Gods servants say, God is my Witness, and my Record is on high.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To other Men. Thus the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> often appeals to his people to their very Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, as far as they could know and observe him, that his desire was to do them good. <hi>Thess.</hi> 2.1. Your selves know our entrance; <hi>v.</hi> 5.

Will thy nearest Relations know thee to be a Holy, humble good Man; thy Chil-know thy care over them, watchfulness, warning, counsel, Holy Example; and so the Servants and Neighbours, and those that have dealings with you in your Trades and Places.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To a Mans own Conscience, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12.

               <p n="1">1.

We should enquire as to the matter of Food or Cloathing, whether what is proper as to the quantity, whether not
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:94151:36"/> too much Sleep, too much Drink, too much Food, as to the Season, whether we mind it not as <hi>Martha</hi> unseasonably; and as her also, as to the measure and manner, whether not too much troubled and careful about it;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.25.</note> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire whether we do not take too great delight in it, promise our selves too much from it: We may undo our selves about these carefull innocent things. As more are kill'd with too much good Food and Drink, then with Poyson; so more are undone and lost eternally by too much care,<note place="margin">In licitis perim{que} vis</note> and delight about those lawfull things, then by Murder, or Whoredom, or Swearing: Men are not awar of the danger here. Whereas, other Sins slay their Thousands, this Worldliness kills its Ten Thousands. Now Men judge this Sin in coveting what is others; but I may have an Earthly Heart, and make up a Worldly Life by Worldly Cares and Fears, and Desires, and Hopes and Griefs, though it be about mine own Estate.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Civil, as about our Calling, Transact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions, Relations <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Here we must try our Work, whether we follow our Imployment in obedience to Gods Command; whether we are just and upright in our dealings, and dare not wrong; whether we are faithful and pitiful, and kind to others; whether we promote and rejoyce in others good, or envy and be-grudge them; whether we are good Parents, and watch over our Childrens Souls, as those that must give an account;

What a dreadfull meeting will there be between wicked Parents and ungodly Children, between carnal Husbands and Wives, that it may be are living to each other, and to their Children, but no Love to God, nor toward others Souls: Live years together, and not one word of God or Heaven, or enquiry about each others Souls. Did Gods Word take place, what Blessed Magistrates, Ministers, Parents, Children, Masters and Servants should we have. If God should send a Messenger to enquire in Towns, Parishes and Families, how matters stand, what they do and speak all day. How few can give a plausible account to a self-judicious Man, with a great and terrible Messenger (I mean Death is coming, and he will not knock at door and crave admission, but will break in and drag you forth before the great God, and then and there must you give an account.</p>

                     <hi>John</hi> 3.20, 21.</note> that they may appear to be evil, and be exceeding sinful, and be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved. We should aggravate our sins, and lye low before the Lord, be asham'd and confounded, God is very angry, when Men
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:94151:37"/> will not say, what have I done? Thou sayest, I have not sinned, I am innocent.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.35. <hi>ch.</hi> 8.6.</note> Says God, I heark'ned and heard, no man that repented. Were they ashamed? God an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers, <hi>Nay, they were not at all ashamed.</hi> This is our great work to search out any secret wickedness, hide and conceal none; to judge and condemn our selves, that we may not be condemned of the Lord. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> and <hi>Asaph,</hi> and other good Men's sins kept them humble and broken all their days.

               <p n="1">(1.) But the Principle or Ground of his Joy, is Inward and Spiritual, rais'd and cherish'd in him by the Spirit of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.17. <hi>not meat and drink, but joy and peace in the Holy Ghost.</hi>

               <p n="2">(2.) The matter of his Joy, or the thing wherein he rejoyceth, is Internal, not in things without him, not in Soul, Estate, good Name, but in a sincere Heart, holy Desires, true love to God, and God's love to, and in him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 4.6, 7. The light of

               <p>NOW methinks each of you that read or hear these lines should say, is all this true? Is it possible? Who are the Persons, what Men and Women, we that are call'd Christians? Well, take heed least that you be not the Persons, and very shortly feel it. Why are you not more awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken'd and consider? Think, what if all this should be true? What have I to say against it? What is the sinful pleasure that I chuse for it? What the blessed work I neglect and am more afraid of than this Hell? Can I plead I never heard of God's wrath, or I did not believe it? Ay, but God told you, it would be so, and he swore to it. I shall not here answer the many Cavils, as that sin is not so bad in our Eye, and others that are sav'd seem'd not so good, or much better than we, and why doth not God help us? And is there no end of this Wrath?</p>
               <p>Lay aside all these Cavils, and reason not thy self into Hell. How sad is the condition of lost Man, that all this wrath will not affright from one Sin, or quicken to one Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? Why will you not enquire into the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? If you are convinc'd and startled, why lye so still in Sin? How can you thus stab and wound your selves every day? Some call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God to damn them, when they should
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:94151:44"/> pray, and cry to be sav'd. In Contempt and Rage swear by the blood and wounds of Christ, that were to save them from this Hell. They shew all Mischief and Spite, act against God; and many hasten others to Hell, and yet think that the very Powder which blows up the House shall scape burning. Will you thus destroy your selves miserably, cut off but one Hand, pluck out one Eye; and not throw Body and Soul into Hell; nay, go with your Eyes wide open to Hell, under Noon-day Gospel-light; sin against your own light of Conscience and Convictions, and against the clear light of the VVord; and you in a very short time destroyed, not stay an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, or five hundred years? no within a day, a month, a year you may feel these Torments.</p>
               <p>I can scarce forbear some Inferences.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Then Sinners are not such mild, sober, merciful and innocent Creatures, as many of them seem and pretend to be; no, they are Bloody, Cruel, and Merciless. They are worse than blood-thirsty men, that destroy others in this Life; we call them bloody Butchers, that kill innocent Beasts for our use; but oh what are these Murderers of Souls? VVe startle and cry out to hear of VVilful, Self-murder; what Soul-killing working is in every Family and Town! VVhat cruel VVretches to themselves! Sins seem easie and pleasing now, can they be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting them? Fishes swim with pleasure in the VVater, in their Element; But if you
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:94151:45"/> put them and the VVater in a Cauldron, and Fire under it, the very Element proves scorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Gods fire of wrath will make thy sins tormenting, that are now pleasing to thee.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Then those Parents, and Masters, and Acquaintance are not so kind, and loving, and tender, as they pretend to their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and Families and Friends, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide all for this life, care only for their Bodies, and neglect their Souls: Cruel in keeping away Food, or not administring it to them that might feed them to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life; nay, it may be give them Poyson. How many bloody, wicked, Soul-destroying Parents? How many Husbands and Wives, cruel to each other this way? tender if a but Finger-ach, if sick, if wounded; but Sin-sick at heart, and not concern'd, not help; how many cruel Friends that flatter and fawn, and sooth each other to Hell. Some breed up their Children in Pride, Luxury, Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, put them into bad Company, place them in bad Families, bad Callings, never pray for them. Better be <hi>Herod</hi>'s Hog than his Child; feed their Horse, their Dog, starve their Child.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Then the Great, and Rich, and Prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Men in this World, the Wise the Migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Successful Politicians, are not such happy and wise Men, as they seem and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be; if they cannot see one Foot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath their Grave, nor one hours happiness beyond their Death-bed groans. No won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:94151:45"/> they cry out at last, and refuse to be comforted; why they are lost to all Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, no comfort, to say, think of your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, your Wealth, your Feasts, your Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture; no, one gripe, one grim look of Death will swallow up all. That Atheisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Politician that declares the success of <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar Borgius</hi> as to all the World,<note place="margin">Machiavle</note> only had not made Provision against his own Death, but poyson'd himself, when provided for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and so blasted all his Designs, shew'd his folly and madness.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Then sin is no such small trifling thing as the World would perswade themselves and others. It's a stab to the Soul to Eternity, cruel Venom and Malignity, spread over all Body and Soul, torment each part. It's a bitter Drop that will so imbitter an Ocean of Eternity. No wonder good Men cry out against it, weep because of it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And then Holiness, and Strictness, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence and Striving in Good is commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, this justifies good men in their greatest and most fervent duties; this shews why they bless God so much for Pardon, why they prize Christ, and all the Ordinances;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ps.</hi> 32.1, 2. <hi>Ps.</hi> 103.1.</note> why 'twas the only thing <hi>David</hi> desir'd above his Kingdom and Posterity; <hi>David</hi>'s Earthly Kingdom is lost, but he hath got an Heavenly Kingdom; this makes good ministers so ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, cry aloud, beg and intreat.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Then they are not in the best and safest Condition, that are most bold in Sin, and fearless of VVrath.</p>
               <p n="7">
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:94151:46"/>7. Then set to this work as your main and only business, in all your affairs; let nothing hinder or tempt you to sin. VVhen one had a great present sent him, he sent it back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and said, <hi>Pray tell your Master, all I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, he may pray, that I may not miscarry for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You have infinite cause to bless God, and admire his Goodness, if you are flying from this wrath to come, and have some hopes, how will it be when you come there?</p>
               <p n="9">9. Now this first sad consideration affords,</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Matter of Lamentation.</hi> 2. <hi>Ground of Expostulation. And</hi> 3. <hi>Matter of Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and serious Meditation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Matter of Lamentation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Bewail the sad condition of thine own Soul; mourn over thy miserable, lost un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done self. You have wept for many trifling matters, and been vext and disquieted about others, their thoughts or speeches of you, or carriages towards you; when they slight you, or deal unworthily, ungratefully, or falsely. But did you ever yet fall out with your selves, and be troubled about the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of greatest concernment, that you should thus wound, stab, and ruine your selves? Could you bewail it with tears of blood,? its not sufficient; oh what weeping and wailing and gnashing of Teeth is in Hell, because of this. How many blessed mercies, rich op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:94151:46"/> choice advantages of doing your selves good, have you cheated your selves of. Nay,</p>
               <p n="1">1. You have contriv'd it, design'd it, stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died all ways how to accomplish this deceit, and destruction. Men are wise to do evil,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Isa.</hi> 29.15.</note> they <hi>seek deep to hide their Counsel from the Lord, and their works are in the dark</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy themselves. All mens design is to wound and hurt themselves, and not be discover'd. As men deal craftily with others, so they do to themselves. Its a sad thing, when a man hath wit enough, and make use of it, to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son himself into Hell, to plead against Good, and for evil.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Men please themselves in this self-undo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Soul-ruining work, they glory and boast in their cunning craftiness to deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.<note place="margin">

                  <hi>The wicked boasteth of his Hearts desire and blesseth the covetous, whom the Lord abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,</hi> through his pride he will not own God, <hi>God is not in all his thoughts,</hi> God's <hi>judgments are far above out of his sight; he hath said in his heart, I shall never be moved, for I shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be in adversity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. There is no convincing men of this folly and madness, and self-destruction. They will hearken to you in other matters. But let the Charmer charm never so wisely,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ps.</hi> 58.4, 5.</note>
                  <hi>they are as the deaf Adder that stops her ear.</hi> VVhat shall be done to convince Sinners? Let Ministers cry aloud, and not spare, shew them their sins, and their danger, it's all
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:94151:47"/> one. God's Messengers cry out, <hi>Who hath believed our report?</hi>

                     <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. lat.</note> God says, <hi>Why will you die, I have no pleasure in your death, I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you would turn and live.</hi> Why have you pleasure in your own death? cannot you pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty your selves? look on your own hands and feet with pity, and think, must these burn in Hell fire.</p>
               <p>Shall I not pity mine own Body and Soul? Shall Ministers weep over me, Parents or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Friends bewail my stubborness and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery, and I not bewail mine own sad conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? I need a soft tender Heart to mourn o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver this hard, rocky, and deceitful Heart. Sometimes I have despair'd to preach of the great things of Salvation. I have been think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I am now going to the sick, to the woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, to the poor, to the dying with offers of Life, Riches and Salvation, but all will be slighted. Were we to offer more of this World, how many would attend? Could we offer and give 10 or 20 <hi>l.</hi> a Week to every one that would pray an hour every day in his Family, how many praying, at least preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Families would there be in every Parish and Town? Alas! men see not the worth of Spiritual and Eternal mercies; that a little Grace is worth thousands of Gold and Silver;<note place="margin">

A man may have a careful, tender Father, a loving indulgent Mother,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:94151:47"/> desirable and pleasing Wife and Children, a pleasant habitation, a competent maintenance, and yet perish; but a Man can't have God for his Father, Christ for his Saviour, the promises for his Portion, and Heaven for his Home and Inheritanee, but he must be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceiveably blessed. And yet no convincing of persons as to their own good most will own and acknowledge this to others; that such good Men are happy, and such wicked wretches miserable, but not apply it to their own Souls.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It's matter of Lamentation as to the whole World, that this deceit is so general and universal; take it as to all Ages. You find all Prophets complaining in their days,<note place="margin">

How sad, that but one <hi>Noah</hi> in the whole World, but one <hi>Lot</hi> in all <hi>Sodom;</hi> nay, the Apostle complains, and Christ himself,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ro</hi> 11.</note> that few would be un-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd: <hi>None Righteous, no not one;</hi> not one that seeketh after God. Had they false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets or good Ministers, still deceitful, and destroying themselves.</p>
               <p>So in all Countries, Towns and Parishes; different persons different tempers, disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, contrary Religions, but all agree in this common deceit of self-deceiving; Let ther be little different opinions in our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, one destroys himself with Pride, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:94151:48"/> with Hypocrisy, a third with Covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, severe against each other, but favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to themselves; some let none escape their Censures, but themselves.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It's to be bewail'd, that this deceit should be so gross, that Men should hasten to Hell with their eyes wide open, run into sin against the clear light of the Word, nay the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions of their own Consciences. As a propahne wretcth confessed, his corruptions were too strong for his convictions and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science: The Apostle says, that such know themselves worthy of death, yet will live and take pleasure in it.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. last</note> Men can't but know that they daily wrong their Souls, and yet go on, eat, and drink and laugh, upon the brink of destruction. How many Thousand in this Nation, that are as merry and unconcern'd as if all were well, they shall find all rotten. There is no need of convincing them that they are wicked, they know it, no nor that wicked Men must perish eternally, they own it, but still not apply this to themselves. To say, I am the Man.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That this deceit and undoing should be of such dreadful consequence, and yet not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded. Were it the loss of an Eye, or an Hand, or House or Cattle, it were sad; but to lose Body and Soul, God, and Christ and Heaven, and all good; and this loss irrecove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and irreparable, never to be made up in it self, nor to be made amends for any other way; nay, to fall into dreadful and unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:94151:48"/> misery and torment. How can this be sufficiently bewail'd.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Here is matter of Expostulation.</p>
               <p>May I expostulate, and yet reason with you Sinners, will you yet hear and consider, that have rejected so many Councils and calls?</p>
               <p n="1">1. Why will you die Sinners? Death is terrible in it self, but what is eternal Death? Why will you love Death, and chose it above, and before Life? If others will die, and no stopping them, you can't perswade them, why will you destroy that being, that soul and body of your own? What hurt have you done your selves, that you have such inplacable malice against your own Souls, as to chuse cursing rather than blessing, and Death rather than Life. What have you to plead for Sin? What is there so desirable in it, as rather die your selves, then that Sin should die? Are not Soul-saving ways better for the present; is not sobriety better than temperance and excess, patience than passion, contentment than covetousness. All the ways of Sin are hurtful, troublesome and bitter.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let me expostulate with you about self-salvation. What have you to plead against it? Come let us reason together: Are not your ways un-equal, and these ways equal? Is it not a blessed thing, to live, loving, and honouring and praising God on Earth, as your Friend, Lord and Father, and come to enjoy him and all good with him to all Eternity?
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:94151:49"/> Is not Heaven large, and good, and long enough to reward all your labour of Love? Are the terms too hard, and the way too strait? Can you desire such matchless glory on easier terms? Do not you labour and sweat more for this World, that promises little, and performs less? Will it not cast you off at last, and afford you but a small hole to lay your dead stinking Corps in; but in this way you may have an House not made with hands, eternal in the Heavens.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Would you have Christ do more for you, die or suffer more for you? Can you buy at an higher, at a dearer rate? To save you lost, and utterly undone; he might have given Kingdoms for you, but in this he had not shewn so much love; in this God and Christ acted to the highest; he might have made more glorious Heavens and Earth, and shewn more power and wisdom, and have destroy'd and punish'd sinners more terribly, and have shewn greater wrath; but could he shew greater love than this, to die and lose himself for a time to win and gain you. Now will you tell him to his face, that his Blood was needless, and that you were not so dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully lost, and wretchedly undone, that he should die to save you? He knows better than you; how earnestly could I plead with you on this account. I beseech you by the mercies of God,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Psal.</hi> 2.1.</note> in the bowels of Jesus Christ. If there be any consolation in Christ, if any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in his love, if any bowels of mercy,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:94151:49"/> think on those things, and do not destroy your selves, when Christ hath done so much to save you. Why will you be-grudge him the purchase of his Blood, the travel of his Soul? All he requires, is, let me save thee, let me love thee; Can you deny such requests? If you will deny him, and perish rather, yet why will you spit in his face, trample on his blood, and make it common or unclean? Why will you in derision and contempt swear by his blood and wounds? Why will you call upon him to damn you, when you should pray to him to save you? If you will not prise his yearning bowels, do not kick at them, do not make his wounds bleed, and <hi>Crucify</hi> him a fresh; Why do you sometimes pretend love? Why do you laugh at those that do prize him, and boast of other bargains and lovers? What shall be said to Sinners? Christ would have you give up your selves; he begs you, though you are his before, he will accept it as a gift, he will but borrow you to mend you, and give you back to your selves again; he will but take away the dross, your filth, your sickness, your burden; he will make you sound and heart-whole, he will crown you with Glory and Honour, and make you truly good, and of worth; now your Heart is deceitful and desperately wicked, hard and unbelieving, he will make it tender, humble, and Heavenly, and so for Head, Tongue, and Life.</p>
               <p>But If you will not hearken to, and love Christ, yet love your selves; if you will not
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:94151:50"/> accept of this Salvation, he will burn, he will destroy you. He that now woes and intreates, and came at first lowly and meek, will come shortly in flaming fire, reveal'd from Heaven with his mighty Angels,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1.7.8.</note> to take ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of thee.</p>
               <p>What shall I say, would you have Christ woe and intreat more, send other Messengers, and make other proposals, can he offer you more than he doth; more than himself and Heaven, and all in it; is he not altogether worthy and able? Can others do any thing for you, is there any other name? Can you help your selves without him?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Matter of information and serious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration.</p>
               <p n="1">1. What an unspeakable mercy is it, if we are in a hopeful way of being sav'd from all this dreadful wrath; if we are undeceiv'd.</p>
               <p n="2">2. On the other hand how sad is their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that have no friends, or helpes to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceive them; not only a deceitful Heart within, but careless Parents, bad Examples, wicked Neighbours? all flatterers and no friends to their Souls.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Then it's a business of great concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and a work that requires care, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullness, pains, and diligence to have this Body and Soul eternally sav'd; were it so easie as many, most think, so many wise and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and rich and wary Men would not mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry so wretchedly as they do.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:94151:50"/>4. We have cause to admire and prise the free Grace of God, that can save from this dreadful Hell, and make us unspeakably happy.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="5" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. V.</head>
               <p>I Come to the Second grand Motive to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade Men to consider seriously; what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing there will be within, what an unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able mercy, if Body and Soul are sav'd. I need not enter upon this large subject; there are many excellent choice Treatises to shew the Glory and happiness of Heaven; none doubt but that it's enough, large, and sweet, and lasting enough, that believe any thing of that Blessed State. Could you but believe that your Bodies should rise out of the Grave, and meet the Lord in the Clouds in the Air, coming with his Milions of Blazing Angels: Eye hath not seen, nor Ear heard, nor can it be thought on answerable to its greatness. To be deliver'd from all those Miseries and Sins before-mention'd, and have thy Body and Soul instated in Glory, when others shall cry to the Mountains to fall on them and hide them from the wrath of the Lamb, and their Hearts failing them for fear, then to lift up thy head with joy, because thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption draws nigh to hear God say, <hi>come thou blessed,</hi> when he says to another, <hi>go thou
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:94151:51"/> cursed;</hi> cast others into lakes of fire and brimstone, and bring thee into his Blessed Presence, in whose Presence is fulness of joy, and at whose right hand therr are pleasures, Rivers for abundance, the Rivers of God for excellency and for duration for evermore. Did you believingly think, I shall very shortly be with Gods Saints and Angels, now I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst troubles, Toads and Vipers, but I shall very shortly sin no more, and God will wipe away all Tears from mine eyes, and none can rise after his blessed hand. How little and inconsiderable would this World seem with all its crosses and comforts, did you believe this, you would throw this World as dirt and dogs-meat at your heels.</p>
               <p>Do you judge those great and good things can be had without seeking, or very easily; your the nature, greatness, worth and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuality of them, no worth call for life, vigour earnestness. You may triffle about straws and pebbles, sleep and be weary, dull and droanish, at your meals, about your mony, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But you can't pray so, to such a God, and for such a Heaven. Whatever sinners think of it, they will find and know one day, that their was more labour requir'd on Gods day, then on their own; more life, zeal and fervency requir'd about eternal life and everlasting glory, than about houses of clay, and this trash. A great God must have great praise, great fear, and honour duh to his name. We can't love him as God, unless
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:94151:51"/> with all our Heart and Soul:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.5.</note> Nor must the greatness of the work affrighten or discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage us. Is it not my concernment to be blessed and happy as well as another? Why may not my Tongue praise God, and my Heart love him? This is the way good Men walk'd in, they did strive, and pray and wrestle; and if I would have their mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and priviledges, why should not I do the same work? If I expect the like Harvest, I must sow the same Seed.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.7.</note> Have I any thing to do at present, that is better, or of greater or nearer concernment? Can I expect such mercy and salvation any way else? What are the desires, hopes, fears, love and joy of the Soul given me for, but to these ends; they will be lost any way else? If I love a friend that is dying, or may be false, it can't answer my love, I love the life of an immortal Soul, that would love an immortal, never-dying, ever-living, ever-loving God.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Be fully satisfied, you may be more sure of this happiness, than of any thing else. That these eternal mercies may be yours, and you made everlastingly happy, that all the Devils in Hell, and all the Men in the World can't hinder you, nor deprive you of it. We have all the assurances imaginable of being made fully and compleatly happy in Heaven, whatever can settle any inheritance or good to Men on Earth, God hath declar'd in his word, that all such ways Heaven shall be made sure to us. It seems so great and good,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:94151:52"/> and we so vile and unworthy, that we are apt to fear and doubt, it can never be our por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and inheritance. I might divide this into several Heads, in general with respect to God the Father, what can't an Almighty God do by power? what can't the Lord of all the World do in bounty? What will not the true and faithful God do according to his word? what will not a Gracious Father, full of love and tender bowels do for his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren? and as to Christ our Saviour, what will not he give that gave himself, that died, that purchas'd it, that espous'd us as his own, that is our Advocate to plead for us, that is our Conquerour. But I shall rather take them as so many distinct Heads. We have it by Gods choice of us, by his good will to us, by his free gift, by his mighty power, by fitting and qualifying us; by adopting us, by making us new creatures, we have it by Birth, by title of Law, by agreement on both sides, by purchase, a price sufficient paid for it, bought to the full; and by sale and bargain, we must buy it too; by conquest, Christ conquering for us, in us, and by us; by near Relation and Son-ship, by solemn engagements, Gods Promise, Writings, Oath, his Seal; by clear evidences in us, our desires, hope, faith and joy; we have the earnest, the fore-tastes of the Spirit; we have the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of Heaven, our Names Written there, and the consent of all there, we have it as wages and reward, and we have it in present
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:94151:52"/> possession. But of all these I shall speak apart, and particulary afterward.</p>
               <p n="1">1. On our parts it's clear, in our desires after it, expecting, and waiting, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, and believing, and striving, and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and rejoycing in hope; all those are clear evidences within us. God had never wrought these things in our Souls, but that he will satisfie, and answer them.<note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3.</note> He that blesses the Body, in satisfying its hungrings, will abundantly fill the hungry Soul. He hath begotten us again unto this lively hope, to an inheritance incorruptible. He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves is said to have everlasting life, and to receive already the end of their Faith, the salvation of their Souls, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.34. know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in your selves, that you have in Heaven a better and enduring substance.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It's firm and sure in it self, so that this truth stands firm upon the strongest assuran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as sure as the great Almighty God can do it, as sure as an all-wise God knows how to do it; as sure as a faithful true God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but do it; as sure as a gracious Father, full of tender bowels, will save those he dearly loves; as sure as Christ the Son of God did not dye and suffer in vain; as sure as his Blood cannot be as Water spilt on the ground, and lost; as sure as he must see of the travail of his Soul, and be satisfied; as sure as he and his Father cannot, will not suffer any to be pluckt out of their hands; as
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:94151:53"/> sure as the head is above the Waters, and his members cannot be lost, but must have a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat body, and not a member of his mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal body cannot be broken off; as sure as he will not loose his ransom; as sure as he can save to the uttermost; as sure as he will not break the bruised Reed, but bring forth Judgement into Victory; as sure as his Prayers and Intercessions are always effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and prevalent; as sure as the Holy Ghost is a comforter that will abide in and with you for ever; as sure as God will never set the Seal of his Spirit on the Devils Coin; as sure as the peace Christ and the Spirit gives is such as the World cannot take away; as sure as these special gifts and graces are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out repentance; as sure as they are an incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible seed, of an immortal nature, a well of Water within that will spring up to life everlasting; as sure as your repentance is such as you shall never repent of; your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, and hungrings, and thirstings such, as nothing but eternal mercy will satisfy; as sure as your Hope, Faith, and Joys are fixed on eternal Objects; as sure as God will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver alter one iota or tittle of his word, but Heaven and Earth shall sooner fail; as sure as the rich, full, and over-abounding pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of grace and mercy, are Yea, and Amen, in Christ, and shall never prove dry Breasts and empty Wells. What shall I more say? the time would fail me to tell of all the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surances in the word, and in this world, and
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:94151:53"/> the other. I shall not mention this Heaven, this Sun, Moon, and Stars, this Earth that seems to stand so firm; I shall not mention the love of the tenderest Mother to her suck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Child, she may forget: But I shall sum up all; as sure as all the preparation and provision by God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, made in Heaven, shall not be in vain; so surely shall you be wonderfully, un-altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, compleatly, and everlastingly blessed, if you are truly Good, and sincerely Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It may now be expected that I should insist largely on this great and astonishing Happiness, if self be sav'd to shew how great this Salvation is. There are many excellent and choise treatises about it. I can scarce forbear to enlarge on this great and weighty subject.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Your Being at present you prize and value, if any way comfortable, full and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable; but I might shew you, this will render your Being transcendent and surpas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing; it's set out by whatever is pleasing, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable or profitable, to raise our esteem and value of it; the word tells you its beyond these Ears and Eys,<note place="margin">

VVould you get Bread of Life, Water of Life, a Sun that will never set, a Life that will never end, Friends that will never dye, nor fail you, an Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation that will never cast you out; then be wise for your selves, I mean for your Souls.</p>
               <p>How glad would Men be to continue this being in prosperity to all Ages; but were
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:94151:54"/> it possible, how low and mean to this above.</p>
               <p>But then for the Soul,<note place="margin">Si talis <hi>&amp;c.</hi> qualis erit splendor animarum.</note> how great and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, shining and transparent, pleasant and joyful, rich and beautiful; oh this breath of God, this temple of the Holy Ghost, this seat of all Heavenly Graces, this partker of the Divine Nature. What will this Soul know, love and see; what the joys of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding are above the sensual pleasures; much more will this be above all that is said of the Body.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Take them both together, it is to make a rich, perfect and full Being; nothing wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to compleat your Happiness.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Would you be happy with all kind of Happiness, with all Mercies and Blessings Can Heaven and all in it, can God, Christ, Angels and Saints make you happy? There is a Kingdom and Crown, durable Riches and Righteousness, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.7. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Glory and Honour, and Immortality. As all Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles, and Stars, and Torches disappear at the rising of the Sun; so all these earthly matters go out at the shining forth of the Sun of Righteousness in all his Glory. When Christ comes at last, and thy Body and Soul mount up into the Clouds, into the Air to meet him, and go triumphing with him into Heaven; then all the Angels and Saints ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in their shining Robes, with Palmes of Glory in their hands, and Crowns on their heads, and the high praises of God in their mouths. What joy and triumph, when you
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:94151:55"/> shall find you are sav'd, after all your falls and fears, doubts and distractions, deliver'd out of Captivity, a Prison, a Dungeon, a Held, and brought to this unspeakable, matchless Glory. If such comfort now in Ordinances, in seeking God;<note place="margin">Si tum sua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris quaeren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis quam invenienti.</note> if one day here be worth a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand elsewhere, what is a glympse of this Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, worth all we ever had in our whole lives. Great and manifold is that goodness God hath and doth lay out upon us here every day; but oh how great is that goodness God hath laid up for them that fear him; we have many mercies in this vale of Tears, in this howling Wilderness, what shall we receive in our Heavenly <hi>Canaan,</hi> in the mount of Glory?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Would you be happy and blessed thus in the highest degree, to the fullest measure? There is great difference in our joyes and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness here. Much difference between the joy at the finding a lost Groat, and a lost Child, long lookt for full of Fears, and at last found. How thy Heart leaps for joy, at the sight of a Christ! Here we soon over-reach, over-look, over-hope, promise our selves much in such a condition and relation, and disappoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;<note place="margin">Nec Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus, nec cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>untus by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbolen.</note> but expect as much as you will here, not deceiv'd. Did <hi>John</hi> leap at the Salutation of Christ's Mother. How will thy Heart leaps for joy at the sight of Christ, oh that Christ that dyed for me, that lov'd me so dearly, that woo'd me so lovingly, that prevail'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me so often, that ravish'd my Soul with
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:94151:55"/> his love; oh how fill'd, rais'd, and ravish'd at the sight of him! What joy to the Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal to be receiv'd into his Fathers Arms! How sweet the home and rest to the weary Traveller! is Inheritance to the Heir! a Feast to the Hunger-starv'd! an Haven to the tost and almost Ship-wrackt; all this, and much more will this be to thee.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Would you be thus happy without any mixtures, allays, or intermission? Here if we delight in a Child, or Friend, there is one thing or other often imbitters it. Fain would the fond, foolish, indulgent Mother please her self, glut her Eyes with, and Glory in here Son, and it may be he scorns, laughs at her, and is stubborn; but if one thing be pleasing, many other matters are cross. There 'twill be all joy, no sorrow, all day, no night; here is a time to weep as well as to laugh, there is nothing cross or disturbing, God always shining, Heaven always pleasing, the Company all delightsom.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Would you be so happy for ever, then be thus wise for your selves. Here Men in all their Glory and Abundance have a damp at the thoughts of Death. Methinks it deadens me in reading the brave glorious Atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Alexander</hi> and the <hi>Caesars,</hi> and their success, when I think, but where are they now? That saying seems severe of one to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotle.

               <p>How God commends them for their Faith? <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. How doth God speak to them, speak peace? <hi>Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, speak ye comfortably to</hi> Jerusalem.<note place="margin">

How doth he speak of them, call them his Jewels, his Portion, his Inheritance, the Apple of his Eye.</p>
               <p>What great things doth God do in them, and for them, to shew how precious they are in his sight; give them all Grace, root out
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:94151:61"/> their Sin, change their Natures, make them partakers of his own Nature; what hath God done for them,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1, 3, 4.</note> born a love to them from all eternity, given his dear and only Son out of his Bosom to dye for them, which is more than if he had given Sun, Moon, and Stars out of Heaven for them.

               <p>God gave them an excellent Body, and wonderfully maintains it, curiously wrought at first, as with needle-work; that the Eye should see such vast Heavens and Earth at a glance,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ps.</hi> 139.15 quasi acu pictus.</note> that so defended with Eye-brows, shutters to clap down, eight or nine defences for that little curious part, the apple of it; that the Tongue can make such a noise, speak so distinctly; who could make a piece of flesh make such a sound, that the throat made so curiously, as to receive down Meat and Drink, and convey'd into all parts of the Body? How many wonders in every part:
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:94151:61"/> That the Teeth set so exactly to meet, grind, and chew the Food; that the Hands plac'd at the ends of the Arms of such a length from the Body, as to help, relieve and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend every part; that all the Joints and bones so hung, as to move all presently; that we can bow down, sit, kneel down, lye along, rise up so conveniently and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably, that the Brain is defended with such a thick scull; and the Heart barracado'd and fenc'd with such Bones; that we can stand upright and walk on such a small part, and the Foot of that convenient bigness and breadth, as to bear up all the Body. That one Leg of that length, as to be mov'd a convenient distance from the other, and so make speed; we may say, all my Bones, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news, Joints and Arteries may praise thee.</p>
               <p>Much more might be said of the Soul and the intellectual part. But all this is common; certainly you cannot think that God gives this to them as to his People; when many swear with their Tongues, and their Eyes full of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ntiy. Withall, how doth God maintain their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies? How many excellent, curious Creatures given for their delight and support; Sheep and Oxen seem only to have their Life, as Salt to keep them fresh and sweet for Man, when he pleases to take them down for his use. How many innocent Creatures dye for them to live? What a glorious Fabrick made for them to view forty or sixty years, to pass thorow to their Heavenly <hi>Canaan;</hi> and then
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:94151:62"/> to be burnt up; not good, and great, and rich enough for them, there they must have a new Heaven and a new Earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness. But in this life God provides and gives greater and better things; oh what a Treasure in one Bible, what a blessing in all the Graces.</p>
               <p>Every day God feeds them with Bread of Life, with Angels Food, and often with the body and blood of Christ.</p>

               <p>God is ready to do much more for you; he would give you much more, hath bid you ask what you will. But what will he do for you to all eternity; he will receive you to himself, and you shall be forever with the Lord, he will guide you by his Counsel, and bring you to his Glory. He will at the great day bring you forth with great Glory; set the Crown on your Head, put the Robe of Glory on your Back, and the palme in your Hand; and joy in your Heart, and the high praises of God, and the Song of the Lamb in your Mouths. Then Christ will say, <hi>Come ye blessed of my Father, here is a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom prepar'd for you before the Foundations of the World; I told you when you were on earth, if you suffer'd with me, and for me, you should reign with me.

               <p>Then God will reward you openly: Here are your secret Prayers which no Eye saw, nor Ear heard, all in sincerity to me in secret; these Almes, these Fasts out of real love to me; here your Faith and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience. I told you your labour should not be in vain. I give you all this glory, as God said to <hi>Abraham, Look East-ward and West-ward,</hi> &amp;c. All this Kingdom of glory I give unto you, <hi>enter into your masters joy,</hi> this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enter into you. It's too great, too rich, too large and astonishing. Though 'twas a narrow way, and a strait gate, that made you strip and stoop, yet you see it was to a great Pallace, a large Kingdom.</p>

               <p>SInners here on Earth, nay good humble Christians are too apt to fear, and think that this is too great and too good news to be true; what! for God to reward my weak im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect services, with such a massy Crown, such a ponderous weight of Glory, I that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd not the crumbs that fell from mine own Table, to have bread of Life, and sit down at my Father's Table; I cannot reckon my present services worthy to be compar'd with this Glory: How comes it to pass, that I that was but of yesterday, it's but a little while since, I had not a Being, and now to expect an eternal Being. When <hi>Saul</hi>'s Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants told <hi>David</hi> of being the Kings Son, he answer'd, <hi>Seemeth it to you a light thing to be the King's Son in law, seeing that I am a poor man, and lightly esteem'd;</hi> and to God he saith, <hi>Who am I,</hi>

                  <hi>O Lord God, and what is my house, that thou hast brought me hitherto? And this was yet a small thing in thy sight, O Lord God, but thou hast spoken of thy Servants house for a great while to come,</hi>

                  <hi>and is this the manner of Man, O Lord God?</hi> How were <hi>David</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers astonisht at this great kindness for an Eternity to come; <hi>for thy words sake, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thine own heart hast thou done these great things.</hi>

               <p>Well, but if God will choose you, quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy you, adopt you to be his Heirs and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and give you all this Glory, and give you all the assurances that can confirm any Estate and Happiness, that can make it firm and settled, you have no cause to doubt and question.

               </p>
               <p>We have this happiness made sure in it felf, and to us.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We have it by Choice, by Election.</p>
               <p n="1">1. God ordain'd and design'd this Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness for Us, and Us for it. Before the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the World,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.1.</note> God had thoughts of Eternal Mercy and Love to our Souls.</p>
               <p n="2">2. God hath since propos'd and proffer'd it to us; which he would not have done, but that he is ready to make good his part to us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Nay, God earnestly perswades and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treats us to accept of this unspeakable, Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Mercy. Oh what large, loving, and earnest invitations; is any thing in the World like it? The Apostle says,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20.</note>
                  <hi>As though God did beseech you by us, we pray you in Christs stead,</hi> strange expressions.</p>
               <p n="4">4. God commands us to seek and accept this great Mercy, and it's our sin and diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to refuse or slight it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.3. <hi>How shall we escape if we neglect so great salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:94151:64"/> He bids us first seek the Kingdom of God, and lay up our treasure in Heaven, and lay up in store for our selves a good Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against the time to come, that we may lay hold on Eternal Life, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.19.</p>
               <p n="5">5. We are chosen out of the rest of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind for this Eternal Salvation, to be for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver with the Lord. God will not loose his choice. <hi>Many called, but few chosen,</hi> but these are <hi>chosen to Salvation,</hi>

               <p n="2">2.

It's Gods own to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of, and he may do with his own what pleases him, as Christ says, <hi>Mark</hi> 10.40. It's a sure possession, when the right is in the Donour, and he freely makes it over to you. Though you are mean and unworthy, God is not asham'd to be called your God, and he hath prepar'd a City for you, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.16. Great things <hi>Araunah</hi> gave to <hi>David,</hi>

He hath bid us ask whatsoever we will.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We have it by his mighty power wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in Us, and for Us, preparing that for us, and us for it. Says Christ, <hi>John</hi> 14.1, 2. <hi>Be not troubled in my Fathers House are many mansions, and I go to prepare a place,</hi> and then on our part; we are kept by the mighty power of God thorow Faith unto Salvation, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4, 5.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. This is done by buying us out of Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, redeeming us with this purchase.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.14.</note> We were Captives and Bond-Slaves, sold under Sin and Satan. There is a great price given to redeem Captives out of <hi>Turky;</hi> we could not be got off without a great Ransome. The Devil, the World, and Lusts challenge a right in us; now Christ buys us from out of this cruel bondage, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18, 19. We are not redeem'd with corruptible things, <hi>but with the pretious blood of Christ;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Christ challengeth a right in us, as his own, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.20. <hi>Ye are bought with a price, therefore ye are Gods,</hi> v. 19,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.23.</note>
                  <hi>and ye are not your own.</hi> Therefore the Apostle reasoneth strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. that if Christ dyed for us, we
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:94151:67"/> should live to him, because we shall live by him eternally. <hi>We have redemption through his Blood,</hi>

                     <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.7. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.14.</note> who hath deliver'd us from the power of darkness, and translated us into his Kingdom. Christ hath purchased you with his own blood, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. and hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem'd us from the curse of the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13.</p>

               <p n="3">3. Nay, God is pleas'd to join us in as joint Purchasers, and will have us put our Hands and Hearts to the bargain, and God deals with us as if we bought it. Christ says, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.18. <hi>I counsell thee to buy of me gold tried in the Fire, Isa.</hi> 55.1, 2. Come buy of me though you have no Money nor price to lay down.

                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Maet.</hi> 19.27, 28, 29.</note> why, says Christ, <hi>you shall have a kingdom.</hi> Alas! what a small matter was it, why a few Fisher-nets. On the other
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:94151:67"/> hand, <hi>Esau</hi> sells this Birth-right for a mess of Pottage, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.16.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 14.18, 19.</note> Thus Sinners sell Grace, Christ, and Heaven for the trifles of this World; they make as it were a bargain; give me Food, and Cloathing, and Health,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.7, 8.</note> and Ease, and Prosperity, and take the Gospel, the love of God, the pardon of sin, and a Kingdom of Glory, and deny the Lord that bought them, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. Now a good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian accounts all here but Dung and Dross, for the excellency of this knowledge. But above all he prizeth, and embraceth, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mires Christ, that bought this inheritance for him, and Him for it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. By paying our Debts for us: A Man may be Heir to a large Inheritance, but such In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrances, and vast debts may lye upon the Estate, that he may never come to enjoy it. Indeed we are deeply in debt to God, to the Law, and to our own Consciences. But Christ cancell'd all these Debts; we could not pay one farthing; we were Debters to the whole Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.3. Jesus Christ ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled the Law, and bids us pray daily to God to forgive our Debts, and we may plead his Blood and Merits, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.13, 14. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving all Trespasses, and blotting out the Hand-writing of Ordinances against you, nailing all up to his Cross.</p>
               <p n="6">6. We have the Title clear'd up by Law, because there are many Controversies may arise, and we loose our Writings, and often
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:94151:68"/> blur our Evidences; the word is clear on our side, the title hath been tryed, and all is well.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Judge is on our side, and approves of our right.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Advocate and Counsellour pleads our Cause, and prevails.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Title is clear'd, the Writings pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced and owned.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Witnesses are many, and credita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and believ'd.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Enemies are baffled, their Mouths stopped and they asham'd.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Forfeitures are cancell'd, and the Accusations answer'd.</p>
               <p n="7">7. All Assessours, approve of the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on your side.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The Law is satisfied, and we are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</p>

Though we deserve nothing; yet to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage us in our work, God will reckon it to us as a due debt, as our hire, and we may humbly challenge it as what belongs to us. That is, as bottom'd on Christ's merits, founded in rich grace, and grounded on Gods gracious promise; so that now God tells us he will reward every man according to his works, and he will not forget our work and labour of love, and our labour shall not be in vain; and having fought the good fight, and kept the Faith, we shall have a Crown of Righteousness as well as of Mercy.

               <p n="1">1. He publickly owns all this, and makes

Whom having not seen, ye Love, in whom, though now you see him not, yet believing, ye rejoyce with joy unspeakable, and full of Glory, receiving the end of your Faith, even the Salvation of your Souls. Faith goes up into Heaven, and views the Mansions, and feeds, and lives upon that Glory above. What says the Apostle 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17, 18. We faint not though the outward Man decays, the inward man is renewed; why there is a far more exceeding and Eternal weight of Glory, it's just before us, and by Faith we look above these lower things, to those not seen by the bodily eyes, that are Eternal; and therefore, <hi>Ch.</hi> 1.

<pb n="128" facs="tcp:94151:73"/> and Wait. As Faith is the Evidence of that Glory, so Gods working that Grace in the Soul, is a sure Evidence of his giving that Glory.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Upon this flow forth earnest and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate desires, breathings and pantings, groanings and longings; which nothing but this Eternal Glory will satisfie. God hath begotten in you those immortal desires, that only God and Christ, and Heaven, can fill and answer. When <hi>Luther</hi> had a great Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent sent him, he goes to God, and solemnly protests, that he would not be put off with these things.

                  </note> the Living God. <hi>Psal.</hi> 17.15. As for me I shall behold thy Face in Righteousness, I shall be satisfied, when I awake with thy likeness: Whom have I in Heaven and Earth, but thee?

                     <hi>Ps.</hi> 73.25, 26.</note> that is worse; both fail, that is worst of all, however thou art the strength of my Heart and my Portion for ever. God hath wrought such Hungerings and Thirst<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in the Soul, that nothing, but Bread of Life, Water of Life will satisfie; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are these carried out in Prayers and Wrestlings, and are bid to pray, and seek, and cry for no less than this Crown and Kingdom.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Upon this is grounded a firm and sure Hope, which wonderfully supports and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courageth
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:94151:73"/> the Soul; which God would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have wrought and given, but that he will answer and not disappoint it, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.2. in hopes of eternal life, which God that cannot lye hath promis'd. <q>See he hath begotten us again to a lively hope, to an inheritance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

That we might have strong consolation from this hope, this hope is an Anchor of the Soul, sure and stedfast; this Anchor is fast'ned on the rock Christ Jesus, that all the Waves and Storms cannot shake or at least break. Why should God deceive or flatter such poor Worms, to raise in us such hope, if he would not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill it. If we do not deceive our selves, God will not fail nor deceive us.</p>

               <p>I might propose four grand Enquiries of moment, to be searcht into, and Answer'd.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Q.</hi> Who or what this Self is, that is to be sav'd or lost?</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Q.</hi> Since nothing is so near and dear, how is it that the most deceive and undo themselves?</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Q.</hi> How great and dreadful is the loss, if Self be lost?</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Q.</hi> How may we save our selves, or prevent this loss?</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Query.</hi> Who or what this Self is, that is to be sav'd or lost.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:94151:76"/>1. <hi>Neg.</hi> It cannot be meant wicked sinful Self; it's pity this should be call'd Self; this is wholly to be cast out, cast off, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horr'd, or else true Self will be utterly lost. The Apostle, indeed, opposes himself to this, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.25. <hi>With the mind I my self serve the law of God, but with the flesh the law of sin;</hi> therefore comfortably and boldly concludes, <hi>v.</hi> 17. <hi>It is not I, but sin which dwelleth in me;</hi> for a wicked man to say so, is to say, <hi>It's no more I, but my Self,</hi> for he is nothing but a lump of sin; his Head sinful, full of vain wicked, worldly, proud, envious thoughts, he can say as to his Lusts, how many and sweet, (as <hi>David</hi> does of his God) he does meditate in those lower matters day and night, morn and even, and at noon, seven times a day, from the rising of the Sun to the going down of the same, his Head full of the World, Sin, and Vanity, he says to it, when I awake, work, and walk, I am still with thee, his Heart full of Wickedness, <hi>Math.</hi> 15.19. Evil Thoughts, Murders, Adulteries, Fornications, Thefts, False-witness, Blasphemies, what a Cage of unclean Birds, what filthy crawling ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.5. The Heart evil continually, only so, deceitful above all things, and despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately wicked, hardned, proud, obstinate, unbelieving, full of mischief, pride, and envy; now all this trash and filthiness must be cast out, and such Self renounc'd; and the Heart must be made of Stone flesh, made pure, clean, tender, broken, teachable, so
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:94151:77"/> might I have had shewn, Ears open to Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Eyes full of Adultery, not cease to sin; the Throat an open Sepulchre, Feet swift to evil. But these blind Eyes must be open'd, these deaf Ears unstopped, these Mouths fill'd with Prayers and Praises; it is a whole Body of Sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.24. This certainly is not the true self.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Worldly Self, nor all the things of this Life, that belong to the Body, with all Relations, and dearest and nearest Friends, are not this Self. Though these conduce much to the comfort of our Lives, and to the support of Self; yet all these may be sav'd, and Self lost and perish.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is a sinful worldly Self; when Men seek these things wholly and only apart from God, thus are they said to eat for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and drink for themselves, <hi>Zech.</hi> 7.6. fast and feast to themselves, <hi>v.</hi> 5. If they pretend to pray, it's but howling, and cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only for Corn and Wine, <hi>Hos.</hi> 7 14. This men judge, seeking themselves, it's a mistake. Men are undoing themselves in thus over-loving and over-caring about the World. Here and there some ride full post to Hell in full excess of Riot, but how many go on softly and smoothly to Hell in worldly cares, fears, joys, hopes, or sorrows. This is a self, Soul-destroying sin, without great noise and observation. You may mark out a Drunkard, a Swearer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But a worldly
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:94151:77"/> wretch passeth for a sober man, and shelters himself under Scripture, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.8. worse than an Infidel, if not provide for himself, his own. Whereas this was spoken against the Widow, that liv'd in pleasure and luxury, <hi>v.</hi> 6. the Idle that wander from House to House, and eat others labour, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 3.11. It's far from encouraging sinners to mind no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Earth, and not mind Heaven, not touch the Bible, or put up one prayer all the Week; nay, be grudging the Lord's day as too long and needless, <hi>Amos</hi> 8.5. <hi>When will the Sabbath be gone.</hi> Certainly that is no Self-love, but Self-hatred, else why is the word of God so much against it? Christ says, <hi>Math.</hi> 6. no less than three times, <hi>Take no thought,</hi> 25, 31, 34. <hi>Love not the world, nor the things of the world,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.15. <hi>You cannot love God too, v.</hi> 15. besides what is in it but the Lusts of the Flesh, the lust of the Eyes, and the pride of Life, <hi>v.</hi> 16. and it is not of God; that is the love of the excesses, greedy desires and reachings after more gain; and Ambition, Vain-glory, affecting great Honour; it all passeth away, <hi>v.</hi> 17. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not worth our love, that shall last for ever, if fix'd on God the eternal object. God accounts it Adultery in Men or Women, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.4. though men think they may thus love the World and God too. No, you make this your God, and it is Idolatry; you must not labour for the Meat that perisheth?<note place="margin">

               <p n="2">2. There is a loving Houses, Money, Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, Friends, Relations, and that is not this true Self-love. If it be excessive it's dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and destructive; loving Wife, Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, Children, too much, is a great sin, a great snare; when Relations are pleasing, they often lull asleep in sin and security, more than when froward and cross sometimes. How many loving Husbands and Wives, tender indulgent fond Parents and Children hurt and destroy one another, kill with this kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; many such loving tender Relations spend away their precious hours and days to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in sloth, folly, and Idle discourses, and go on together quietly to Hell. Not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke one another to love God and to good works. What a dreadful ghastly meeting will there be at the last, between careless in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent Parents, and wicked, loose, idle Children; when the Child shall say, my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

               <p>To come yet nearer, loving ones own Body apart from the Soul, is not this true Self-love; nay, often Self-hatred, as Flesh and Spirit are oppos'd; this is call'd Self in some sense, as <hi>Job</hi> 1.12. <hi>All that he has is in thine hand, only upon himself lay not thine hand, chap.</hi> 2.4, 5. Therefore Satan says, the Cattle and Goods, and Houses not so near, but touch him close to the Skin, <hi>v.</hi> 5. touch his bone and flesh, so <hi>v.</hi> 7. he smote him with sore boils. I confess this seems near Self, and it is part of Self; but how many thousands ruine their Souls, that take great care of the Body. All your care may be what to eat, and what to drink, and what to put on, strive, run and ride, rise early, and go to Bed late, spend your strength, and labour hard, <hi>Isa.</hi> 55.1, 2. and yet perish for want of real Bread, and what will satisfy and do you good.

               <p n="2">2. Why then certainly the Soul of Man is the true self. At first Man is denominated by it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.7. <hi>And man became a living Soul.</hi> What the Soul of the Man is, that the Man is.

In the former, it is, he loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth his Soul, in the later he looseth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, or is a cast-away, therefore Christ saith, we should not fear them, that cannot kill the Soul, <hi>Math.</hi> 10:28. and God bids sinners incline their Ears to him, and hear and their Souls shall live, and their souls shall delight
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:94151:79"/> in fatness, <hi>Isa.</hi> 55.2, 3. all is well, when the Soul lives and prospers. <hi>Come unto me,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>Math.</hi> 11 28, 29. <hi>and you shall find rest to your Souls.</hi> Therefore the Wise man saith, and God by him, <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.30. <hi>He that winneth Souls, is wise.</hi> As a man gains or loseth his Soul, so is he blessed, or misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. What doth an Hypocrite gain? when God taketh away his Soul, <hi>Job.</hi> 27.8. truly, just nothing. What a Fool was the rich man, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.19. to say thou hast Goods laid up for many years, therefore Soul take thine ease; alas, poor wretch! his Ground and Barns had not suitable Food for his Soul; but God says, <hi>v.</hi> 20. <hi>Thou fool, this might thy soul shall be required of thee;</hi> that must go to another place, and then whose shall all those things be? So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, <hi>v.</hi> 21. and is not rich towards God; that which he mistakes for himself, but is not true Self. When God at first made <hi>Adam, Gen.</hi> 2.7. God made the Body of the dust, but the Soul was the breath of God, and therefore it is said, <hi>Man became</hi> a living Soul: That was the Man, that No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, High, Heaven-born Being. Oh that Men did but know the worth of their Souls, immortal Souls, capable of enjoying God to all Eternity, made by God at first as part of himself, and redeem'd by Jesus Christ, and therefore a Soul is more worth than a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Worlds, what give in exchange, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, not all the World? And how are

Each of you have a Soul within committed to your Charge and Care, that is more than if you had an Empire, the care of the whole World. It's what the Soul, is that the Man is; and so all the good that concerns and constitutes that, makes the man.

                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>That yet nothing is nearer or dearer than this Self.</hi>

                  <item>3. <hi>That if this Self be lost, all is lost.</hi>

                  </item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Prop.</hi> Most men are in danger of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, undoing, and loosing themselves. Some loose their Money, some their Credit, others their Trade, many their Health, some their Lives; but most loose their Souls, themselves, that are wise and careful to save
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:94151:80"/> all other things. They are not sensible of this loss, nor so much afraid of it. Many that will not give you a Penny, nor a Shilling, will give you two or three hours of precious time, more worth than thousands of Gold and Silver. Many that will be watchful you do not pick their Pockets, rob their Houses, cheat them in their dealings, will lock up their Chests, their Houses, watch against Fire and Storms, and yet will let the Devil and the World rob them of their Prayers, of their Reading, hearing, steal away the Word, some not suffer Weeds in their Gardens or Fields, will suffer Cares and Riches to choke the good Word.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 13.19, 22.</note> Many that are wise and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident, saving and scraping for the World, are very expensive, lavish, and prodigal of precious seasons, and means of Grace. This is not the condition of one, or a few here and there, but it's indeed the sad foolish condition of the most. Many shall be wise, give good advice about Mens Affairs in the World, and others shall take good counsel and warning about their Estates, their Ground, their Cattle, their Friends; and yet be altogether negligent of their own good, and love not faithful dealing about their Souls. It's strange to observe many, they will feed their Horses, their Oxen, their Hogs, and starve their Souls; save, if possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, all things but themselves. Angry with any that will cheat and cousin them, and in the mean while cheat themselves, and not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleas'd.
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:94151:81"/> Nay, many Learned, that understand most Languages, study deep Points, skilful in Arts and Sciences, but ignorant of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, careless of their own Souls; know many, most things better than the state of their own Souls.</p>
               <p>Many good Husbands, thrifty about their worldly affairs, sober and innocent as to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and yet wholly negligent in their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to God, and so cheat their own Souls. Many Women good Housewives, provident and industrious about the World, but never pray to God, nor think seriously of Eternity. You may find the House cleanly, the Food wholesom, and savory, their entertainment courteous, their behaviour obliging, the House well order'd and furnisht with neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries, and the Soul and Life all out of order, the Head empty of saving knowledge, and the Heart dead and harden'd in sin; not one word of God or Christ with delight and seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous enquiry. The Bibles lye in their Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, but very seldom in their Hands, taken up seldom all the Week, unless on the Lords Day,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.1.</note> and then read in a customary care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less manner; not search and dig as for a hid treasure, far from crying after know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, seldom or never down on their Knees alone one quarter of an hour, to pray for Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, or a Kingdom of Glory. Alas! alas! can the most thus delude and deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and think this is striving to enter in at the strait Gate, and that this is taking Heaven by violence.</p>
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:94151:81"/>
               <p>How many Trades-men, Husband-men, Labourers, Servants, Parents, Children, all busie about other matters, and neglect their own Souls, spend two, three, or four hours in idle tattling, it may be sinful and vain, at Cards or Dice, or speaking against their Neighbours, whole Winter Evenings spent in a sluggish, lazy way, telling idle stories by the Fire, not a Chapter read, and if pray a quarter of an hour, that is too long, and they are weary and sleepy, but not a word of those complaints before. Thus all foolishly deceive themselves, and whole Families go quietly to Hell together; some quarrel, and discontented go on in a more broad and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen way to Hell. Some spend days and nights in Taverns and Ale-houses, many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious idle hours and days in Coffee-houses, and such publick places, where men are cheating themselves of time, that is more pretious than all the treasures of the Earth, throw away the Purse, and then throw away the Jewels and mony in it. It's a season to pray in, to love God in, to prepare for Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in. Yet the most, I had almost said all, are guilty of cheating themselves daily of their best treasure, and yet complain and cry out, when God comes to take it away by death. Why should God continue that, which they know not what to do with, but call their sports their pastimes to wast it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way? You will find at last, there was not one hour or day in your whole life, that you
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:94151:82"/> could say, This is mine own, and I may do with it what I please. What shall be said or done to convince the most of this folly and madness?</p>

               <argument>
                  <p n="2">2. Query. <hi>Whence is it, that men are so apt to deceive and lose themselves, when nothing is so near and dear and nothing can make amends for this loss?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is worth our serious Enquiry.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. IT is from our selves.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. From others.</p>
                  <p>I could give many Reasons from our selves.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. Here is one in the Text, because we think our selves to be somewhat. It's hard to convince Men, that they are nothing, Men will deceive themselves. Who could imagine, that men should be poor, and blind, and miserable, and naked, and yet think themselves rich and need nothing, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.16, 17. men are not such Fools and so mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken about this World. Will any men sow Chaff, and expect to reap Wheat? And the Apostle says, <hi>Be not deceived, God is not mocked;</hi> no doubt of that, if we deceive our selves and others, God cannot, will not be cheated. Hear <hi>v.</hi> 7. following my Text. <hi>For whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he reap.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.7, 8.</note> Who doubts of that? yet <hi>v.</hi> 8. though men sow to Corruption, and for Hell, they hope to reap Heaven. Again says the Apostle,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:94151:85"/> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9. <hi>Know ye not, that the unrighteous shall not come to heaven, be not deceiv'd?</hi> inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating, that such gross abominable sinners are apt to deceive themselves, and Idolaters, and Adulterers, and Drunkards, that live and dye so shall be sav'd; ay, but they are deceiv'd. Now is not this common amongst us, do not such as never pray, such as are ignorant, prophane, idle, ready for every evil work, reprobate to good, lye down and rise up, bid their Neighbour good mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and good night, eat and laugh, plow and sow, and reap, take all the times and seasons, and never fear Hell, nor care for Heaven, and yet doubt not but all will be well, and be angry, if any question or doubt of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. From non-consideration, from want of serious consideration, and diligent search and enquiry. Men will not sit down and consider what they are, what they ought to be, what they might be, what they are do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nor whither, they are going. They are not at leasure, at least not at present, it may be they may hereafter. I doubt not but there are many in Hell, that did resolve to call themselves to a strict account once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they died, but that once never came. One adviseth, he that would resolve to repent One day before his death, should this present day, because he knows not whether he shall have a morrow. Oh! that men could be brought to this great duty of Self-examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:94151:85"/> and serious Consideration, and to put some close and searching questions to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. Am I really converted, and new-born, or no? Am I a Child of God, or the Devil? Certainly there is and must be a vast diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt Heaven and Hell, and there must be a very great difference betwixt the Heirs of such Glory, and the Fire-brands of Hell. Can I think, God will give such match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Glory to the one, and throw the other into unquenchable burnings, but that he makes a mighty change on the one here? Wherein doth it appear, that I differ from others, that I fear are going in the broad way to destruction? What do I more than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, do not even the Worldlings and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal the same? What if I should be deceiv'd and undone to all Eternity? What if I cry peace to my self, if God speaks not peace, if his Word speak no peace, if mine own Conscience and Life speaks no peace? What small matters do satisfy and content the most? Had they no better Evidences for their Estates, no better grounds to Hope well, as to their Health and Lives, than they have about their Souls eternal Life, how uneasie and restless would they be? But men will not set some time apart, sit down alone, search their Souls and Lives, debate matters with themselves; some such questions as these may be of a great use. I know I was born in sin, and conceiv'd in iniquity, have I found any real change, can I say, whereas I was
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:94151:86"/> blind, now I see? Again, every day I am bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, Head, Heart, and Hands employ'd. Are my thoughts Spiritual and Heavenly? Can I say to God,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ps.</hi> 104.34</note> my meditation of thee is sweet, and in the multitude of my thoughts, let them be of the great and rich things of the World,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ps.</hi> 94.19.</note>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ps.</hi> 139.17, 18.</note> or of the troubles, crosses, and losses, <hi>thy comforts delight my soul.</hi> Nay, cry out experimentally, <hi>How pretious are thy thoughts to me, O God, how great the sum, more than the sand, when I awake I am still with thee.</hi> Do I love God with all mine Heart and Soul, and hate every false way? Do I pray as one that believes God will hear and answer? What are all my Prayers, if they do not reach Heaven, and mine Heart and Life? Do I believe that some mens Prayers are an abomination,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Isa.</hi> 1.11. <hi>to</hi> 14. <hi>ch.</hi> 66.3.</note> as well as their swearing and cursing? Do I groan and sink under the sin I confess and beg pardon of? Do I grieve, weep in bitterness of Spirit? I must weep now, or roar in Hell. Am I restless, crying mightily and continually to God, till I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain pardon, peace and healing? Alas! the most do but trifle in their solemn addresses to God? Where are the Persons that do pour out their Souls in Complaints and importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Requests? Do I verily believe, that God delights in those Prayers,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 18.1 <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> and not delight in them my self? Why should I deceive my self with empty dead services, that God is not, cannot be pleas'd with, as good never a whit, as never the better? How many, would they
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:94151:86"/> sit down and consider, would find, that they verily believe God will not hear them, nor regard such work; is it such a Prayer, such a Fast, such hearing as I delight in? And therefore have they not boldness in God's presence. Thus may you search and inquire as to every Duty, and the whole course of your lives. Consider and enquire, am I now doing what God requires, both for matter and manner; can I expect God should say, <hi>Well done, good and faithful Servant,</hi> when I am doing little or nothing that is good? Can I believe that this is stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to enter in at the strait Gate, at least so to seek as to be able? May I not fear,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 13.24.</note> though I should at last say, <hi>Lord, open,</hi> I have heard many Sermons, read many Chapters,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>v.</hi> 25, 26, 27. <hi>Math.</hi> 7.25 26.</note> that God should say, <hi>depart, I never knew you,</hi> that is, to approve of you, or delight in you. I knew your Hypocrisie, but not your sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Can I think that all I do from morning to night,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.24, 25, 26. <hi>The slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard lying lazy and i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, said,</hi> O utinam hoc esset laborate.</note> from the beginning of the Week and Year to the end, is running, and so running as to obtain. Is this striving as for the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery, fighting as for a Crown? Is this idle, lazy, sensual, vain, unprofitable life, labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and watching, and taking Heaven by violence? For the Lords sake, for your Souls sake, search and deceive not your selves. Would you but bring your Hearts and Lives, words and works to the Touch-stone, to the Balance, to the light of the word, and stand to a trial? What trash, what triflings would
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:94151:87"/> you find much, that now goes for duties and services. Alas! men will not be faithful to themselves.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Did Christ, the Apostles, the Prophets, and all the good men of old thus live as I do? Did not they deny themselves, go cross to the stream and course of this wicked world, were zealous and abundant in doing good; pray morn and even and at noon, seven times a day pray, praise, meditate on the word day and night, have respect to all God's comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements? Now I hope for the same mercy, call the same God Father, hope he will love and defend me as them; why then should I not do the same work, as well as expect the same reward? If I have <hi>Jacob</hi>'s God and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, I must have <hi>Jacob</hi>'s hope and reliance; if <hi>Abraham</hi>'s blessings,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ps.</hi> 146.5.</note> have <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Faith, Obedience, Self-denial, be ready to offer up our <hi>Isaac's</hi> also. I know not, why we should not labour to be as any of those before us; pray and praise, and love as much. Can we think, that those things were written only for us to read what they did and said?<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.4.</note> why, they are gone to Heaven, but we must believe the same, do and suffer as they. The Apostle plainly says, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.11, 12. <hi>Every one of us must shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope to the end, nor must we be slothful followers of them, who through faith and patience inherit the promises;</hi> that is, if we will come to their end, to their rest and happiness, we
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:94151:87"/> must tread in the same steps, go the same way daily.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Can we imagine, that God should give so many counsels and warnings, so many precious choice encouragements, promise such great and good things, only for us to live careless, loose, slothful lives? Need so much be said, to persuade me to rise, eat, drink and be merry, or walk in the Fields, follow my Trade, it may be pray or read a quarter or half an hour; on God's day read an hour longer, hear a Minister pray and Preach an hour or two, get home and eat and drink and never speak of the word more; though never so many rules, follow not one of them farther than it consists with mine ease, interest, or humour?</p>
               <p n="1">1. Would a man consider things aright,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. <hi>last.</hi>
                  </note> is this to be stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in God's work, because God will abundantly reward us;<note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.5. <hi>to</hi> 11.</note> is this to be fervent in Spirit, not slothful in business, to give all diligence, to work out our Salvation? Is this to spend our selves and be spent, to pray without ceasing, to pray evermore, to watch and pray, to pray and not faint, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.1. need we put on the whole Armour of God for this? <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.10. <hi>to</hi> 17. need we a Breast-plate, an Helmet, a Shield, a Sword for this? Need we watch and take heed, and keep our Hearts with all diligence for this?</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="158" facs="tcp:94151:88"/>2. Are we not asham'd to think, that God should give us his Spirit, his Grace, his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, his Gospel, such a blessed Word to enable us, and yet to do nothing; that God should change us, turn us from darkness to light, open our Eyes, Ears, and Hearts for nothing? Did we but consider how many expressions there are in Gods word to this purpose; that his Grace shall be sufficient; that his strength shall be manifested in our weakness, what to do just nothing, or what is worth nothing? Are we not born anew to great and high things?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Can we enjoy such rich, choice, and distinguishing priviledges from the rest of the World, and not do more than they? What be God's Children, Christ's Brethren, his Members; and all for mean low work. Say, what the Children of the King of Heaven do such low fordid things, such base vile things? Would men but put some searching questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, how soon would they shake their confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and yet so easily deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Am I not asham'd and confounded to think, that God should now promise, and at last give, a Crown and Kingdom unto me, that am so slothful, careless and unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? Its true, I enjoy great Priviledges, but do little work; I confess, the best and most faithful unwearied Servants must acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that the doings as well as sufferings of this present time, are not worthy to be
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:94151:88"/> compared with the Glory that shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd in them, and wonder, that their light work, which is but for a moment, should, thorow rich Grace, work for them a far more exceeding and Eternal weight of Glory, and it may be well said,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 12.32.</note> that Eternal Life is the free gift of God; and that its their Fathers good Pleasure to give them a Kingdom; there is no compare between the work and the wages; therefore God says, <hi>Well done,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 25.21.</note>
                  <hi>thou good and faithful Servant, thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things.</hi> But then how can I, that have not only laid up many of my Masters Talents in sloth and idleness,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>v.</hi> 26.28, 30.</note> but have wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted away most of them in sin and excess, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that God should say <hi>well done?</hi> When I have neither been a Servant, nor good, nor faithful in a few things; but rather expect he should say, <hi>thou wicked and slothful servant; take all from him, and cast that unprofitable servant into outer darkness.</hi> Why should we thus flatter our selves? When God says, not only the tree that brings forth bad, but the tree that brings not forth good fruit, must be hewn down in judgment and cast into the Fire.</p>
               <p n="2">2. From others. Another great cause of our deceit, is, from others; but this also ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth from our own folly and wickedness; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers could not hurt us, were it not from our selves.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:94151:89"/>1. By comparing our selves with others, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. measuring themselves by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and comparing themselves amongst themselves, they are not wise. Men are apt to think, I am not worse than my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and most about me are as bad one way or other as I am, and they are not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and why should I be so inquisitive and solicitous? Indeed here and there is one, or a few, more precise and exact, but those have their failings another way. I will venture with the rest; this is a dangerous snare; men argue not thus as to this World; my Neighbours are many of them poor, and therefore I will not endeavour to be rich. But God plainly tells them, that the most go on in the broad way to Hell, and that you must not follow a multitude to do evil. There was but one <hi>Noah,</hi> one <hi>Lot,</hi> one <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caiah;</hi> was it any ease or relief to them, that they all perisht together? but if those that appear good are bad otherwise, God casts them off, if really bad; if but failings, God is severe against them, as against <hi>Moses, Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, David, Eli,</hi> and many others.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By resting upon the judgment and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of others, or rather upon their connivence, silence and forbearing you.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It may be, others say nothing to you, let you alone from day to day, and week to week. It may be Relations, near and dear Friends, some careless Parents. You may
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:94151:89"/> be apt to think, (if you think any thing at all about it) were my condition so bad, so ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dangerous, some would be so kind to tell me mine own, and warn me to flee from the wrath to come. But we meet each other of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, salute kindly, enquire of the bodily welfare, about the times and our affairs of the World, but not one word of God, nor about our Souls; surely therefore there is no danger. But,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Consider that few, very few, are really concern'd about their own Souls, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you can't expect they should be so about yours: They are sick themselves to the very Heart of the same Disease, of sloth and carelesness, and sensuality, and can you rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably expect they should reprove, or warn, or exhort you to those duties, that they do not mind themselves? besides, they are busily employ'd about the same worldly designs and matters, as you are, and are not at leasure, nor have they any Heart for these great and spiritual things; they are of the World,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>John</hi> 8.23.</note> therefore speak they of the World. Christ makes a great difference betwixt his and the rest. <hi>John</hi> 17.14, 16, <hi>They are not of the World, even as I am not of the World, therefore the World hateth them.</hi> Now, were you ever hated and persecuted, because you differ from the World? you rather please your selves, that you agree with them.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:94151:90"/>2. Those that are concern'd about their own Souls, yet know, that you will not take it kindly, if they speak plainly to you: You know not their thoughts of you by their silence. Most think hardly of each other, though few speak plainly and freely; judge not by their silence, that they approve of you. There are very few faithful Friends to Mens Souls. It may be some are so guilty them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, that they are asham'd, as well as afraid, to reprove, warn or admonish you.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It may be others commend you to your faces, think well and approve of you, this is a dangerous snare; and yet it doth please and tickle the most; but what is this, as to the goodness of your condition? Men are very false and deceitful, and may commend you, when in their Hearts they condemn you; they are weak and shallow, and see not your insides, nor know your Hearts, and observe but little of your actions, and are apt to pass a false judgement for or against, as they are pleas'd and affected. They know not your down-lying and up-rising; besides, 'twil stand you in no stead, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. <hi>last. Whose praise is not of Men, but of God.</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.18. <hi>Not he that commendeth himself, nor whom Man, but whom the Lord, commendeth, is approved.</hi>

He looks upward, with triumphing joy and admiration, to the Crown of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Glory; their Hearts leap for joy here in hopes of it; how will it be, when just entring into Heaven?

               <p n="1">(1.) There is a dismal Grave to receive his pamper'd filthy sinful Body, a mighty change from all delicacies, and care and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance; the Bed of Down chang'd into a Bed of dirt and bones, and a little after into a Bed of flames; the well-built House with deckt Rooms, furnish'd and adorn'd, glass Windows, Doors and Out-lets, chang'd into a dark hole, shut up, not the least breathing hole or crany of Light; warmth and washing, rubbing and cleansing the Body, and other things chang'd into a lump of nastiness, and what is loathsome and corrupted.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) But then he looks lower, and sees Hell open for him, Devils gaping, unquench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able burnings to receive him; how shall he die? he dare not die, he can't live. Now his Ears hear nothing but screitches and roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, his Eyes behold all dismal ghastly Objects.

But when the wretch looks backward, what a ghastly sight, all his Sins, his Pride, wantonness, idleness, hypocrisie, what not; O the swarms of filthy vile thoughts, the multitude of wicked sinful words, a whole Life of Sin: Now Death will set them in order before thee; here will be a reflection</p>

               <p n="2">2. What you might have been, and done; what blessed Seasons of Grace lost, I might have Pray'd, Read, Heard at such a time, when I was idle, vain and foolish. I was on my Bed of sloth, or in idle Company, when I might have been upon my knees, wrestling with God for Grace and Mercy; how well might it now have been with my Soul?</p>
               <p n="3">3. But alas! what a sad condition have I now sinn'd my self into? I can't look back on one hour, on one duty, with comfort. Every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, every mercy, every judgement help to increase my torments, poor wretch, mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable wretch, wicked wretch that I am, though I receiv'd so much from God, I scarce ever did him one hours hearty Service all my days; I have done much against him.</p>

                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:94151:93"/>4. When he looks forward to the day of Judgement, there he sees Christ that once came to woe him,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1.7, 8, 9.</note> to save him, now coming in flaming fire to Judge, to destroy him, and that for ever; whither shall I fly or run, I must appear, and I must be condemn'd, and to unquenchable burnings? When that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour shall come in the Clouds with his mighty Angels, and the Saints meet him in the Air, I must hear the dreadful Sentence. <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.41. <hi>Depart,</hi> from whom? from peace and happiness for ever. <hi>Depart, thou Cursed,</hi> what Christ call me so? with his word goes the Curse and Vengeance, and seiseth on the sinner; but whither, back to the Earth again, or to a Dungeon or a Prison, or into the Grave again? no, into fire, scorching fire; but how long? for ever, Ever-lasting fire; when Ten Thousand years out, as new as at first, <hi>prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</hi> What cursed, dreadful ghastly Company, what affrights and amazements are some in, under apprehensions of Appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? How terrible, a Dream? What will it be to be cast amongst them? <hi>O tremendum Dei Judicium,</hi> the Ancients call'd it.

                     <hi>Heb</hi> 10.31</note> Did you never see a guilty Rogue stand trembling in his Chains before the Judge? and do not standers-by tremble and melt, to hear the Judge, (and poor weak Man that must stand trembling before this Tribunal also,) when this Judge gives the

               </p>
               <p n="5">5. When he looks upward, there is an Heaven, but no entrance for him; he says, <hi>Depart, I know thee not,</hi> that is, to love thee or save thee; there is an angry God, whose face is a flame of Fire against thee, that smiles on others, and bids them welcome.</p>
               <p n="6">6. When he looks inward, there is a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Heart, a stinging Conscience, there is all in an uproar; whereas the good Mans Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science is a Mount-Tabor, a glimpse of Glory, an Heaven upon Earth, a Kingdom of Goodness within him, thine is a terrour to thy self and to all about thee, an Hell upon Earth. None need accuse dying persons, then severe enough against themselves, that would not bear others gentle mild Reproofs before.</p>
               <p n="7">7. When they look outward, without and about them, all witness against them; their Friends cry for them, but can cry out against them; their Beds witness their sloth, it may be their filthiness; the Frames, the Timber, the Stones, cry out against them: None to pity, nothing to help, whereas good Men leave their friends with comfort, and can say, I am not afraid to die.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If you are lost and thus miscarry, all you have, or seem to have, or be, is nothing to you. What is a great Name, Applause,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:94151:94"/> Honour and Respect, to a dead Corpse, to a damn'd Soul? Alas! that you could but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see and know it, for your good and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage? What if others, many others, have good thoughts of you, 'twil stand you in no stead. When a person is to be Tryed for his Estate or Life; he thinks all of his own side, represents it so to his Counsellour and friends; they say, he need not fear, be of good courage, all will be well; but when the person or Cause is brought before the Judge, the Writings are brought forth, the Witnesses called, and things appear quite otherwise, the Cause is lost, and the Man Cast and Condemned; what is he the better for his own good thoughts, or others good words? We are very favourable to our selves, and cry, <hi>Peace, all is well. Rom.</hi> 2. <hi>beg.</hi> Judge others, but not our selves; others speak fair to us, but at the last, the great Day, the Books will be brought out and open'd. <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.12. and the Witnesses appear, your own Hearts, Tongues, Lives, your Enemies, your Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; and then all will appear as really it is, and God will pass Righteous Sentence. What doth it advantage you to live in a fools Paradise, to please your selves with a Dream? think now that you Eat and Drink, and in the Morning of the Resurrection awake, and your Souls are empty,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Isa.</hi> 29.7.</note> and you faint and perish: You lose your friends, your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent enjoyments, your Bodies, your Souls; you lose God, Christ and Heaven; What
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:94151:94"/> shall be said to awaken you and do you good?</p>
               <p n="2">2. At present, if you are not good, all you seem to have and enjoy is in Judgement and wrath. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.15. <hi>To the pure all things are pure, but to the impure all is defiled.</hi> It would be too large a digression, to shew, as to all particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This is a great loss; you lose the real good and Blessing of what you now have; your outward mercies and crosses are all in Judgment and Wrath; your Table is a Snare, while the Meat is in your Mouths, the Wrath, the Curse of God is in your Souls: You are fed as Enemies, only fatted and fitted for the slaughter; if you have Pomp and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, abundance and Honour, you are Riding in the greater State to the Worms and rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenness, nay, to Hell and unquenchable burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. Some make more hast thither than others, run full speed by rioting and excess: If you are poor, and sick and distressed, you are falling still lower, never stop till come to the utmost wrath. A good Man falls and riseth again: Many think, because they suffer so much here, God will pardon and save them; alas! suppose your sufferings could make amends for your sins, which can't be, yet they can't procure Gods favour and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.18. <hi>All the Flood not wash away the guilt of the old World, nor Sodoms fire burn up the Lusts.</hi> Many lye roasting and roaring under fierce
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:94151:95"/> wrath,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Amos</hi> 4.7 to 12.</note> and wicked still, so those in Hell. Now a good Man is the better for his mercies, all given in love from God, and all Praise and Thanks given from a loving Heart to God. A good Man blesseth and loves God more for one bit of Bread, than a wicked Man doth for a full Table. A great Man standing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally at a poor Mans door, and over-hearing him give God thanks solemnly and heartily, would go in to see what great Feast he was so thankful for, and found only Bread and little else; he went out asham'd and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, that he was no more thankful for his abundance. Short Commons, serious hearty Grace, are a good Meal, a rich Feast. Many Thousands eat and drink, that do not love and praise God for it. We most of us generally more need Hearts to bless God with, than mercies to praise him for: What a vast difference is there between good and bad on this account? One is for a full Table and a Cup over-flowng, the other for an Heart abounding in Love and Thanks-giving. A Cardinal, riding in Pomp and Pleasure with his Company, stept aside to a poor Man in the fields, and found him weeping, and askt him why he wept? he answer'd I was looking on this Toad,<note place="margin">Surgunt indocti, &amp; rapiunt Coelum, dum nos voltamus <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> and admiring Gods goodness, that I was not made such a vile Creature; with it he return'd to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; saying, these unlearned mean persons rise up and take Heaven by Violence, whilst we wallow in sensual pleasures and luxury.
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:94151:95"/> What a sad condition is a wicked Man in?<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Isa.</hi> 26.10, 11.</note> if God feeds him to the full, he waxeth wanton, and kicks against God, and forgets his Maker and Benefactour; if afflict and chastise, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, repine, and it may be grow desperate; that God says, <hi>why smitten?</hi> they will revolt more and more. Let the Prophet go to poor or rich, it's all one. <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.3, 4. <hi>What shall be done to a wicked hard Heart?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It is so, as to means of Grace, and all Spiritual advantages, they are all in Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and wrath to you; Gods Word doth but harden them that do's soften others. The Sun that softens the Wax, doth harden the dirt; that draws out the sweet smell of flowers and choice inclosed Gardens, doth also the loathsome offensive scents and smell of Dung and Carrion. Who would think, that such a choice Evangelical Preacher as <hi>Isaiah</hi> should be sent to shut their Eyes, Ears, and Hearts? <hi>Isa.</hi> 6.9. &amp;c. Nay, that frequent Preaching, precept upon precept, line upon line, should be so abus'd as to make them fall backward, be broken, secured and taken. <hi>Isa.</hi> 28.13. Some think, they scornfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated these words, <hi>v.</hi> 14, 22. as if weary of so much of it; or, as others, they need still word upon word, and all to no purpose,<note place="margin">Quicquid recipitur recipitur ad mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pientis.</note> they still fall into sin, and at last under Gods just Judgement. The word of God is the Savour of Death to some, as well as of Life to others; the same good Seed will not grow in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:94151:96"/> Rocky, stony-ground, that prospers in the good Ground. You may live under powerful means of Grace, sound Preaching and Heavenly Praying, and yet be in a dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable condition: Who could hear a better Preacher, and be in better company than <hi>Judas,</hi> and yet a cast-away, a Devil? Rest upon none of your outward priviledges. Read through the 2d. of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and then judge. I could instance in all parts of the Scripture, the promises are a Rich Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, but none of them are for you. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. <hi>All work for good, but 'tis to them that love God,</hi> all's in Judgement to others. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable, unheard of things, God hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd in Heav'n, but it's for them that Love him. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9. <hi>A Crown of Righteousness for them that love his appearing.</hi>

There are many Wise Men, States-men, ingenuous Artificers, great Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, diligent and good Country-men, that will wisely and carefully take care of all in their way, but themselves.

<pb n="176" facs="tcp:94151:97"/> you may persuade them to Read, to Hear, to Pray, to give Alms, and yet not prevail with them to look into their Hearts, and see how matters stand betwixt God and their Souls.

               <p n="1">1. Rest not pleas'd and satisfied with all the good things of this Life. I hope you are sensible, that the vilest of Men may have all these, and be never the better, but much the worse.

Some are proud of their Estates, others of their Wisdom, a third of their House, Gardens, or gaudy Apparel: An Ass may be laden with your Riches, and yet an Ass still.

How many Thousands have liv'd under able faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Ministers, heard many powerful sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Sermons, and have Pray'd and Fasted, and receiv'd the Blessed Sacraments, and yet are harden'd, dead in Sins and Trespasses? many are Ignorant, Worldly, Sensual; some Proud, vain and masterless in their unrulely Affections and Lusts; others Hypocritical and false to God and Man; many turn'd Atheisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and openly prophane. Some Parishes and Towns, where there have been Learned, Holy and Laborious Ministers, ye not one Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily in Ten, in Twenty, that pray to God, or scarce read the Scriptures all the Week.

How can you live quiet and contented, and so many years hear, and read and pray, and not know whether you shall

               <p n="1">1.

It's very hard to persuade Men of the truth of those things, who hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd our report <hi>Isa.</hi> 53.1. <hi>few or none.</hi> It's true, not many deny it and laugh at it, though more now adays than formerly; yet those that deny it not, do not actually believe these things. If so, it would make a mighty change in the World. Men would sit down and weep, and refuse to be comforted, till some hopes of being sav'd. Did Men verily believe, that such and such Sinners must in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitably perish, and that in a very short time, and that they are in this dangerous condition; could they live as the most do? The <hi>Israelites</hi> were shut out of <hi>Caanan</hi> because of their unbelief: <hi>God sware in his Wrath, Heb.</hi> 3. <hi>last.</hi> and what doth the Apostle make of it? <hi>v.</hi> 12. <hi>Take heed therefore, Brethren,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:94151:103"/> lest there be in any of you an Heart of unbelief.</hi> and <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.1. <hi>Let us therefore fear, lest we come short,</hi> it can't be meant of that Earthly <hi>Caanan,</hi> and therefore must be understood of Heaven. Christ saith, <hi>He that believeth not on the Son, hath not Life, but the Wrath of God abideth on him.</hi> This cannot be understood of believing only that Christ is the Son of God, or that he is come into the World, or that he died at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and is <hi>Ascended into Heaven.</hi> If this Faith were enough, the Devils might be sav'd, for they confest that he was <hi>the Son of God?</hi> and the Apostle says, <hi>the Devils believe and tremble. Jam.</hi> 2.14. to 20. there he fully declares, <hi>That Faith is dead without Works,</hi> that <hi>is, no Faith.</hi> As the Body is a dead Carkass without the Soul. Do you so believe a God, as to fear, honour, and obey him? so believe in Christ, as to prize him above all? <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.3. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and despise all in comparison of him? so believe a Hell, as to fly from the Wrath to come? so believe a Heaven, as to strive, run, fight, and take Heaven by violence? Alas! where, who, are the Persons in good earnest, that do heartily make it their business to be sav'd? a few no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the head, and empty words in the Mouth, but no lively sense and savour of the things of God within: Will you thus be deluded with a shew and profession? You read of a form of knowledge, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.20. and a form of Godliness; 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.5. a Scheme or Systeme of notions, such as Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:94151:103"/> read to their Pupils; and the other is a Mask, a Vizour, an Appearance, but no good works, very vile under such a shew.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It's therefore very difficult, and, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out true Faith, impossible, to bring Men to the real practical part of Religion, that is, to be truly good, and be Eternally sav'd. It's indeed the mighty work of God, the same God that made Heaven and Earth, that can shake Mountains, that can change wicked Hearts; it's not Means, Ministers, Mercies or Judgments. How many sit under the most lively awaking means, and not mov'd to one duty, nor brought off from one sin? It's difficult to convince Men</p>
               <p n="1">1. That this is their work and business, the business of their lives, they believe it's to be done, but a small matter will serve; they know they can't get Mony, Houses, Estates, without plodding or working; but that it's easie to get to Heaven. Either they think it too hard, too much, and impossible, and so will not lift at a mountain, that can't move a Tree; will not reach at the Sun or Clouds, that can't reach the top of a Tree or Tower. Alas! say, or think, some, we can't Pray at all, and must we do it so often, so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly, so fervently? or else they think it very easie and light; and shall a man lift mightily at a Feather or Straw, that he can move with the top of his finger? or shall a man set out
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:94151:104"/> before Sun-rising, or early in the morn, when he can dispatch his Journy before night? or labour and sweat all day, at the work he can finish in an hour? on these two dangerous Rocks, most split their Souls, and are lost. Says one, I would gladly get to Heaven, but there is more requir'd than I can do; I'le la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for my Body, for my Family, and that's as much as I can do, i'le trust God with my Soul. Let Ministers and Scholars mind their Books, and Heaven, and their Souls, that have nothing else to do. I can never Pray, and Read, and Discourse, and understand, as others. Another says, there is more ado made about it than need; I doubt not but I shall do as well as the best. It's but Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting, Praying, and sending for a good Minister at last, and all will be well. It's an easie short passage to Heaven. A prophane wretch was wont to say, three words at last, <hi>Lord, have mercy,</hi> would carry him to Heaven; and poor wretch, riding over a great Bridge, his Horse started, leapt over, and he was drown'd, the words he was heard to utter, were, <hi>Devil, take all.</hi> It's dangerous jesting about these great things.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It's hard to convince each man that this is his business. Each man must Pray, Believe, Repent for himself. As no man can eat and drink for me, so none can love God for me, repent for me, believe in <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> for me, go to Heaven or Hell for me; none can bear Deaths-pangs and horrors for me. I
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:94151:104"/> know Masters and Mistresses, and great and rich persons take more liberty of spending their time idly, than Servants and the meaner sort; and it's true, the like labour and pains may not be requir'd and expected from you: But I could never yet see any ground from Scripture, or reason, that the greatest Lord or Lady should have more liberty granted to spend a day or a week unprofitably and sinfully, than another? That the greatest could justly say, I have this hour or day to spend as I please; they say, or think indeed, who is Lord over us, our Tongues, our time is our own? They shall find a Lord, that will call them to an account; unless they should think the Master should expect less work from them, because he gives them more meat and wages. Are your hands, and eyes and ears, not made for service? will it be any comfort for you at last, to think, more delicate dishes of choice meat, pleasant Wine and Liquors have gone down this Throat, than others? and these limbs have lain at ease, stretcht on the Couch and Bed, when others have been sweating and tir'd? Whatever Great Persons, and Masters and Mistresses think, their Temptations are great because, under no check and controul: 'Twere well, we had one every night to call us to an account, or that we would call our selves to an account. How many chide their Servants, check and reprove their Children, and in the mean while forget, neglect them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves?</p>

                     <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.14.</note>(1.) Vain and sinful thoughts are hurtful and pernicious; wash thine Heart from wickedness, that thou mayest be saved; how long shall vain thoughts lodge within thee? proud thoughts, wanton thoughts, carking, caring thoughts, covetous, worldly thoughts, envious, malicious thoughts, Hypocritical, deceitful thoughts, blasphemous thoughts; unbelieving the greatness and goodness of God, are gnawing Vermine, Soul-destroying, get into the very Bowels. Christ tells the Scribes and Pharisees that kept a-do about the outside, and were concern'd about what they eat and drink, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. <hi>beg.</hi> That what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they eat and drink, was not so hurtful as what comes out of the filthy Heart. 17, 18, 19, 20, <hi>v.</hi> Out of the Heart proceed evil Thoughts, Murders, Adulteries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> these defile and hurt the Man; what a swarm of noisome Flies, what filthy Serpents and Toads creep out thence? and these hurt and kill; nay, want of good thoughts is hurtful and destroying.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Psal.</hi> 10.4.</note> It's said of the wicked, God is not in all their thoughts; his Heart says,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ps.</hi> 14 beg.</note> there is no God like a fool, a sinful undone fool, as he is; far from having any secret and precious thoughts of God. Now the Soul dies for want of this good food and nourishment, as surely as with Poyson.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="209" facs="tcp:94151:113"/>(2.) Sinful words are also dangerous, hurtful and destroying; many say their Tongues are their own; who is Lord over us? <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 33 to 37. Bad Fruit shews a bad Tree, that must be hewn down and cast into the fire; the stinking corrupt Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication comes out of the filthy dunghil of the Heart, and the open Sepulcre the Throat; but every idle word must be accounted for, <hi>v.</hi> 36. That is not all, but idle words will Condemn and Cast the Man, <hi>Jam.</hi> 3. beg. 6 <hi>v. It's a fire, a world of iniquity, defiles the whole body, sets on fire the course of nature, and it's set on fire of Hell, and therefore must to Hell.</hi> Therefore <hi>ch.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 26. The Apostle says plainly, <hi>If any man seem to be Religious, and bridleth not his Tongue, he deceiveth his own Heart, and the mans Religion is vain. i. e.</hi> That man is lost, is utterly undone, all the World can't save him. How many Curse, and Swear and Blaspheme, and can't think any hurt in it? Some call to God to Damn them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Curse those about them, and any that offend them; others lie, and flatter and dissemble; others speak filthily and obscenely.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Psalm</hi> 12.2, 3, 4.</note> What says the Apostle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.3. to 6. first he says, Fornication and uncleanness is not to be named, it doth not become Saints, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, this many think very innocent; no, says the Apostle, it is not convenient, <hi>i. e.</hi> for Saints; you have other work and use for your Tongues, to praise and give thanks, <hi>v.</hi> 6.
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:94151:114"/> Let no Man deceive you with vain Words, let them think or say what they please, for because of these things, <hi>the Wrath of God cometh upon the Children of Disobedience.</hi> You shoot your bitter envenom'd Arrows against others, but drawing the Sword cuts the Scabbard; the Powder that blows up others Houses or Names, must burn it self: Nor is it only hurtful to speak evil, but not to speak good; in the 19, 20. <hi>v.</hi> he tells you a better use of your Tongues. After the Apostle <hi>Col.</hi> 3.8. advised to put of Anger, Wrath, Malice, Blasphemy and filthy Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion out of their mouth, and not to lie one to another; he follows it 15, 16. That the peace of God dwell in your Hearts, and the Word of Christ dwell richly in you, that they may teach and admonish one another. How can we reasonably expect, that these tongues should praise God in the highest Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, that do not pray unto, and praise him here on Earth? Can we imagine, that God gave us such useful members to imploy only about this lower World, dirt and vanity?</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) I might instance in all sinful works; the filthy unclean person hunts for his own Life, his own Soul, <hi>Prov.</hi> 5.3. Though it seems as an Hony-comb, and as Oyl, her end <hi>v.</hi> 4. is bitter Wormwood, a cutting Sword, as Death, as Hell. <hi>v.</hi> 7. Then mourn at last, <hi>v.</hi> 11. And thy flesh and thy body consumed, <hi>v.</hi> 20.21. Why thus guilty, when
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:94151:114"/> God sees all? <hi>v.</hi> 22. His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and holden with cords he shall die without help. <hi>ch.</hi> 6.32. He that is guilty destroyeth his own Soul, <hi>ch.</hi> 7. last. Much more is said, he is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horr'd of the Lord, though Sinners say it's sweet. <hi>ch.</hi> 9. <hi>v.</hi> 17, 18. It's their ignorance and mistake, the dead are there, and those in the depths of Hell.</p>
               <p>So might you observe in all other sins and sinners;<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9.</note> the drunkard doth but swallow down poyson, his own destruction, for living and dying so he must to Hell,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pro.</hi> 23.29, 32.</note> who hath woe, who hath sorrow, and that often at present, but at last it biteth like a Serpent and stingeth like an Adder; cheating, coze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and defrauding others, is but wronging a mans self most. He lyes in wait to deceive his own Soul; he cheats another of his Mony, his Goods, his Estate, but cheats himself of Truth, Honesty, Sincerity and true Peace.</p>
               <p>Who would believe, that Men in covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness were heaping up not wealth,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. beg.</note> but wrath against the day of wrath, and adding fewel to their own flames? That proud ambitious aspiring Men were falling and sinking by their pride and rising, and that they were getting up but to a higher pinacle to fall down the lower, and with the greater ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance?</p>
               <p>What shall I say to convince you? will you believe, that rejecting and slighting Gods calls and word, you cast away your own
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:94151:115"/> mercies, that you render your selves unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and uncapable of Everlasting Life?<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act</hi> 13.46.</note>
               </p>
               <p>So in all neglect of Heavenly duties and their own work, they lose daily and cheat themselves of much good, of their own peace, life and happiness; lose their time and blessed Seasons, they lose Jewels better than Gold and Silver. It's sad to see, how many are robbing and stealing from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves every day precious hours and choice advantages, this loss will appear in shewing the others gain.</p>
               <p n="2">2. On the other hand, Godliness is your making. Men may run this and that way; nothing but sincerity and a good Conscience will stand by a Man and support him at last; doing good makes the bones fat and the Soul rejoyce. What comfort had <hi>David</hi> in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and praysing night and day, sick and well, banisht, or in his Throne? Great peace have they which love thy Law, and nothing shall offend them; in keeping thy Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is great reward. A Man that is Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly and hearty in Prayer, is getting more than he that is Trading, and gaining Gold and Silver. Little do the foolish mad World know or believe, what a Christian is getting daily upon his knees, he is laying up Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in Heaven; he shall be receiving a full and glorious answer to his Prayers to all Eternity. Where are any such proffers and promises made to any the wisest Worldly
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:94151:115"/> work, as are to Gods blessed and Heavenly work? A Christian is adding Grace to Grace. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> adds to his Jewels and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure; the trial of your faith being more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious than that of Gold. Who can tell the wealth of a sincere Christian? who knows his mansion in Heaven, the worth of his Crown and Kingdom, a Crown not of Gold, but Glory? Who can tell, how much is coucht up in one promise? they are said to be excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding rich and precious promises: What is the greatness of Gods love, the invaluable merits of Christs Blood, the riches of free Grace? What may be said or done to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the World, that Godliness of it self,<note place="margin">

               <p n="1">1. With secrecy; it's all hidden and close, they are not discern'd and discover'd in their cunning, self-deceiving courses. All Men attempt, is, to hide their poyson from others. As Men that would murder themselves, study all secrecy.

                  </note> as at being discover'd or reprov'd once. More afraid of being known to the World for their wickedness, than of being damn'd to all Eternity. God declares often, that every secret thing shall be brought to light,<note place="margin">

The Apostle values not Mens judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, because the Lord will come, and will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the Heart, and then shall every Man have praise
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:94151:116"/> of God that deserves it: What though none know that I am sick, and pained or poor, and I feel the pinching pains and want? What though others know not my secret wickedness, my secret neglects of Closet-Prayer and holy Meditation; my deadness and unbelief in duty; my hypocrisie and falseness to God and Man? this will certainly destroy me. Gods eye is upon me; as one, tempted to wickedness, would not yeild till great privacy, when this or that place was offer'd, where none saw; the party an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd, but Gods eye is here.

The sinners eyes are never open till death, as they report of the Mole. You find in Scripture frequent advice, <hi>hear while it is to day;</hi> this is the day of Salvation; too morrow may be the day of Death and Damnation. He that speaks to day, may choose whether he will speak to morrow. Now, the gentle mild Voice of the Gospel, the next, may be the terrible and loud call to judgement; if you'l not hear God now, he will not hear you then; and therefore bids you seek him whilst he may be found, and call upon him whilst he is near; intimating, that there is a time coming when he will not be found, when he will be a-far off.<note place="margin">

God will not be mocked; he knows, when 'tis our weakness and when our wickedness.

                     <hi>Luke</hi> 10. last.</note> What! the Son of God, the Saviour of the World come to her house with his company, and want Provision and necessaries? I doubt not but she did it out of great respect to Christ; this appears,</p>
               <p n="1">1. She was cumbred with much serving; she was not idle and lazy. Many will have little or no thanks for their caring and carking, and tumbling about the World: I have pitied many poor drudging industrious worldlings, that weary themselves for very vanity.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In that she could come to Christ, and call him Lord, not doubting but that she was well-pleasing to him, carest thou not, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> bid her therefore that she help me. No doubt but many think they are well enough, whilst employ'd about the World all the day, though they forget God and neglect their Souls. She leaves me alone, I do not desire to be idle, I would have her help me.<note place="margin">Ut unà mecum manus ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveat operi.</note> I could be glad to hear a good Sermon as well as she; thus many Worldlings condemn those that take time for Prayer and Hearing, and say, they are idle, they are idle.</p>

               <p>Notwithstanding <hi>Martha</hi>'s care and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision, her confidence and appealing to Christ, her condemning her good Sister; Christ reproves her severely, and justifies and commends her good Sister. <hi>Martha, Martha,</hi> thou art careful and troubl'd about many things; I know not, but Christ may check in her a solicitous, careful, worldly spirit, which may be too predominant in many good people: (as I doubt not, but <hi>Martha</hi> was a good woman; it's said,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>John</hi> 11.5.</note>
                  <hi>Jesus</hi> loved <hi>Martha</hi> and her Sister, and <hi>Mary</hi>) Christ tells her, that her head, heart and hands, were too full of worldly matters, but especially now very unseasonably, when there were greater things in hand. Christ commends, justifies good <hi>Mary,</hi> she sate at Christs feet, she had chosen the better part; this was the one thing needful, this should last for ever. This affords many considerations; that Heavenly things are quietly receiv'd, when Worldly matters afford trouble and disturbance; these things are really necessary, absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, the other not; I may want Riches, Food, Health, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and be happy, and go to Heaven. I can't be happy without this Grace. There are many things, here is but one God, one Christ, one Soul, one Happiness; that is called good, but not so really; it's a false name to call Riches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> good; there is none good but God, says Christ, and there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing really good but what makes us good, and leads us to a good God: Some render

I have often thought Gods day the worst spent of any, in filling and cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the carkass, and ease and sloth; more sins committed on this day than others. Please not your selves with feigned excuses and pretences, God knows what you are, lying down and rising up; what your thoughts, words and works are, and what your temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations; what your care to please him, and
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:94151:119"/> what your wilful and ungodly neglects? Many think to plead their ignorance, their company, their Ministers neglect; God knows, what your helps and advantages were, and wherein you were willingly slothful and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less: Though he with one Talent seem'd to plead much that he had not wasted his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, not spent it in rioting and excess,<note place="margin">

I could never please thee and do as thou requirest, but here thou hast what is thine, I have done thee no wrong. All this will not excuse, thou art wicked and slothful; out of thine own Mouth I will condemn thee, thou knewest how severe I was, therefore thou should'st have been the more careful and exact; had'st thou improv'd that, I would have given thee more; cast ye that unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Servant into utter darkness; would he not work? let him have nothing but weeping and gnashing of teeth.</p>

               <p>Deep sorrow and humiliation, a real broken and contrite Spirit, are the only Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices pleasing to God. Many think, I am sorry for my sins, and can say with the <hi>Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:94151:120"/> Lord, be merciful to me a sinner,</hi> and God forgive me; I know not, whether these triffling prayers, or their curses and oathes, are most abominable to God. Cry out, wretched Man that I am, who shall deliver me? He that said it was Holy and Heavenly, strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and fighting against sin, and cries out under a deep sense, as one undone and sink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. It's easie to say, I abhor my self in dust and ashes. I doubt not, but many confess their sins in prayer daily, and pretend sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, when there is not the least grief of heart, nor trouble of spirit. We have many sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, but few true mourners, in our <hi>Sion.</hi> How few restless and unquiet, weary and heavy laden, and not satisfied till they come to Christ and find rest for their Souls? It's a great, a mighty work, to have this heart really broken. You read of <hi>Ahab,</hi> the Men of <hi>Nineveh,</hi> and many others, who seem'd to repent, but did such false tears ever reach one sin?</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Please not your selves with groundless hopes of mercy and presumptions on Gods love and kindness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You read indeed, that God is gracious and merciful, and long-suffering, but it is added, that he will by no means clear the guilty. Say not, though Men are severe, I hope God will pity and pardon, and save me; ay, but what grounds have you to hope, that he will pity and save you? Are your Names written in
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:94151:120"/> the Book of Life here? then hope and believe it's written above. God hath said, <hi>Blessed are the poor in Spirit, the poor in Heart,</hi> &amp;c. am I such, or no? Should one dream at night of a Pardon from a King, or that such a Mans Estate is mine, and come the next morning for the Pardon, or claim the Estate? and the other should ask, why? what have you to shew for it, any thing under mine hand? and he answer, no, but I dreamt so the last night; he might be kickt out of doors with disdain and anger, and counted fitter for Bedlam. Foolish mad sinners, that knock at Heaven Gates and claim it for theirs; will not God say, What hast thou to shew under my Hand and Seal? where did I ever promise Mercy and Heaven to one that did live daily, as thou didst? Look over the whole Bible, bring me one promise, and i'le make it good. My dear friends, why should you flatter your selves to your own destruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, and no convincing you now, till God doth silence you at last? only say, Lord, I dreamt so, when on Earth; a foolish and fruitless Dream.</p>

               <p>Many Thousands destroy themselves with resolutions, and promises of saving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves hereafter. The time is not yet come. The Devil and your own Hearts, and this wicked World, are cunning sophisters, and
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:94151:121"/> they will not crave all your time together, only have it by peice-meals, till they have all at last: Every morning they will fill you, as soon as you are awake, with other matters, and thus keep you employ'd all the day; and when they have you lull'd you asleep that night, they will be with you the next day, and as likely to prevail; and thus keep you close to themselves, that they shall have the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, and God all the promises; say only to God, I go, <hi>Sir,</hi> but not stir; at night you shall confess that you have sinn'd all that day, but never begin to live better the next day. We should be asham'd to put into our prayers at night, Lord, raise me up the next day, that I may eat and drink and be merry, that I may be idle and vain, and not think or speak seriously of God or my Soul, or another World; or in a morning, pray for a Blessing all the day, but walk out of the way of Blessing all the day after. Should we not blush to say, Lord, Bless me in my idleness, in my wicked company, in my jesting and triffling? well, but we hope to live better hereafter; what! next week, or next year? no, never come to a determinate time, and thus the Devil hath us fast enough. Did you not think many years ago, that if you liv'd to such an Age, you would be better? and have you not the same old, dead, vain and worldly Hearts, that you had long ago? Are you not still as backward to good, as prone to evil, as you were formerly? Have you not resolv'd often
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:94151:121"/> to cast up your accounts and prepare so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly for Eternity, but still you neglect it; and will you still trust these wicked deceitful Hearts, that have deceiv'd you so often? Have not these wicked Hearts left you many a good Sermon, many a blessed Sabbath, many an awakning, searching providence? and are they not as likely to lose you as many more, if God grant them to you? but it may be, you have seen your best days, and God may never grant you so many blessed advantages; how many Heavenly Lights have burnt out, whilst you have been idle and triffling? many lively, serious Ministers, are gone to rest, that did strive, pray, intreat and weep, and could not prevail: If you still believe, you shall be better in such a condition, or such an Age, observe those that are so, and see, whether they be not as careless and negligent about their Souls, as others. Do not you seem as far from Death and Judgement, as you were twenty years ago? God says, <hi>to day hear,</hi> and the Devil says, to morrow;<note place="margin">

What great difference is there in the World? most are hurrying and tumbling with the same care, fear, hope and concernment, about little and great Estates; some pleas'd in a little house made of dirt, and a few cattle and small grounds, another in a lofty house built of stone, great windows, rubb'd rooms and richer furniture, larger demeasnes; but their joys and sorrows are much alike; the one eats and drinks and laughs at the other, only the one hath richer food, or more gaudy Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel; but as many wants and crosses. I could never yet perceive much difference between 20 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> or an 100, or 200, or 500, or 1000 <hi>l.</hi> most live up to or beyond their Estates, and so are uneasie: They want somewhat more; I except pressing want of necessaries, pain, debt and confinement, or melancholy, otherwise I know or see little difference in any Mens condition.

Some great Men, and proud, spend their time in luxury, in commanding, domineering and idleness, others in flattering, and admiring and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauding, though inwardly hate them: Some live twenty years, others thirty, some forty, others threescore or fourscore years, and for my part, when buryed, I know little that he of threescore or fourscore years hath gotten, or can boast of, more than he that died at twenty or ten years, only eat, and drink and sleep a little longer, any farther than he lives more to God, dies to sin, and prepares for Death and Judgement. I know not, what we are the better for the last week and year, and if we live another, what will it amount to? only eat and drink, and sleep it over again.</p>
               <p>I thank God, I write not this out of any discontent, or in the least to slight Gods goodness and the mercies of this Life; length of days is promis'd us, and is a mercy; and I have liv'd as comfortably and plentifully as any Man under my circumstances, far beyond what I could have at first propos'd and expected; but I write it out of a deep sense that hath a long time lain on my Heart, of
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:94151:127"/> the vanity of this World, and the folly of my self and all others; and from great zeal and indignation, that Heaven, Grace and Christ, should be neglected for these toys and trifles. For my part, tho' I had liv'd never so well, I would not desire to live over my days again, eat and drink, and sleep as much, any farther than I might do more good, pray more heartily, and bring more Glory to God. This I find the pretence of most, but it's a most horrible delusion and cheat; they beg time for God and their Souls, but they give it still to the Devil, their Lusts and the World. Act over the same sins, and neglect the same duties, or as triflingly perform them. I know not, what some promise themselves more in this life, were there not a Heaven and Hell, and good work to be done here on Earth, and were it Gods way, I should not value it, if I dug mine own Grave and lye down it, and desire some walking mortals to cover me over. O! that ever this pitiful, empty, troublesome, trifling World, should hinder Men so much in their way to Heaven, and make them venture, yea, and lose their Souls for nought? Will you refuse to be diverted, or to be comforted, by any of these things, nor be affrighted or disturb'd by the miseries or threatnings of this World? Pass thorow this World to your home and rest; order all your matters with respect to Eternity.</p>

               <p>1. <hi>The Word of God.</hi> 2. <hi>Prayer.</hi> 3. <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Go to the Word of God, try your selves by it, and hear and read what That will say; that is your Judge, as that doth justifie or condemn you, so shall you stand or fall at the great day. Now that tells you plainly, foul sinners shall to Hell, and such penitent humble broken Souls shall come to Heaven. You have no Book else that speaks of such great and good things; you need not Ascend into Heaven, nor Descend into Hell,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.6, 7, 8.</note> the Word is nigh thee, even in thy Heart and Mouth, the Word of Faith which we Preach; if confess with Mouth and Heart, thou shalt be sav'd. What plainer than <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.7, 8, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There is no respect of Persons with God, but the wicked must perish, whether <hi>Jew</hi> or <hi>Gentile,</hi> and the Righteous must, shall, be sav'd. Now Men flatter and will speak fair to your faces, this is especially the danger of great Men, high and wise Men. An Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then could say, that a great Mans Son learn'd nothing well but to ride the great Horse; for that knows no difference between Master and Man, and will cast him, if he looks not
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:94151:128"/> to himself: But let him be what he please otherwise,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Psal.</hi> 49. last.</note> others will praise him to his face, and all fear to offend him. Now the Word says, that God will cut off all evil doers, let them be who they will, say to the Righteous, it shall be well; woe to the wicked, he must perish as his own dung, let him be Lord or Beggar, Prince or Peasant. This Word tells them, that the Kings of the Earth, and the great Men and the rich Men, and the mighty Men, and every bond Man and every free Man,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rev.</hi> 9.15, 16, 17.</note> hide themselves in dens and rocks, and can't stand in the day of Gods wrath: This calls the wicked rich Man, Fool, that would not be born from others, but call for a stab. This tells you plainly, what is sin, and that God regards you not, if you regard iniquity, though in your Heart. This tells you, that God will not bear with the wilful neglect of any one known duty; others, pretending friends, say, ease your selves, spare your selves; but this saith, you must strive, and fight and wrestle, and spend your selves and he spent, and give all diligence, and pray evermore,<note place="margin">indefinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> and pray without ceasing. Your wicked Hearts and others tells you, there is no need of much a-do about Heaven, a little will serve turn; but much labour and care is requisite for Earth; but the Word tells you, that you need not be so careful for too morow, that you may use things indifferently, read diligently, and walk circumspectly to the Law and to the testimonies,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Isa.</hi> 8.20.</note> if your
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:94151:128"/> Heart and others speak not according to this Word, it's because there is no Light in them. This shews you Death and Life, Blessing and Cursing, Good and Evil; and this gives plain marks: Search the Word diligently, and bring your Hearts and Lives to this Touch-stone; prove every thought, word and work. Other Glasses are false, this is a true Glass, will shew you your real face and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, this will shew the spots and defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of the greatest, the proudest.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>James</hi> 1.23, 24.</note> Did your curious proud Ladies look more in this Glass, and less in other Glasses, this might humble them; whereas, the other puff them up. I do not now persuade you, only to read the word diligently and daily, but search into it as into a rich Treasure, and labour to make it your own; believe the promises, and suck the sweetness of them; obey the commands, do the work, till you find the goodness and satisfaction of the blessed Laws of God. As <hi>David, Psal.</hi> 119. till you cry out sensibly and experimentally, <hi>O, how I love thy Law, and thy Word is ever pure, therefore thy servant loveth it!</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Go to God in Prayer much; cry migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily to him, who alone can save, and is willing and ready. How much were Gods people ever addicted to this duty? and the truth is, you will certainly perish without it. It's the breath of the Soul to God; as the Man can't live naturally without brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, no more can a Christian spiritually
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:94151:129"/> without praying. But then I must intreat you, as you love your Souls, that you see to it, that you pray indeed; there is much goes for praying amongst us, that will appear but howling, but mockery, but abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at last; beg of God, that he would open your eyes, undeceive your Souls, and set you in the right way: You will certainly mistake, and miscarry, unless he lead and guide you in the right way; and this you must beg every day, as one perishing, sinking and undone: Say, Lord, I shall perish with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hope or help, unless thou stretch out and make bare thy saving arm; pray in secret, poure out your Souls, your complaints, your tears, your earnest requests, nay, seek, yea, if that will not do, knock by earnest Prayer: Say, Lord, what shall I do? these lusts, these temptations, these Sons of <hi>Zerviah</hi> are too hard for me. I am convinc'd of my folly and neglects, often sorry for them, resolve and promise, but all weares off again; I know not what to do, but my Eyes and Heart are up to thee; I want spiritual Wisdom, I ask it of thee,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.5.</note> or I shall be miserably and eternally befool'd; I have but little time more to ask it; in Hell tears or cries will not avail nor prevail. If you can't pray, say, Lord, poure out upon me a Spirit of prayer and suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, the preparation of the Heart to pray, as well as the answer, is from thee. Thy Spirit can teach me, can help mine infirmities; thou hast said, as sure and as freely as earthly Parents
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:94151:129"/> will give to their perishing hungry Children, bread and not stones, fish and not serpents; so certainly and more readily, wilt thou give to them that ask it. Lord, teach me to pray for Mercy, and then graciously give it. Why may not my tongue pray unto thee, and praise thee as well as others? Why may not my Heart breathe after thee, love and delight in thee, as well as others? Hast thou but one Blessing? bless me, even me also, may I say, O my Father. Shall others have bread, and I the husks, ashes, poyson? let me have somewhat, though but crumbs; one crumb of this spiritual Heavenly Mercy is more worth than all the fat Feasts of the wicked. Must I be lost and roar in Hell, and my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some friend, my good neighbour, triumph in Glory? May not I pray in my Family also, read the Word with delight and comfort, find healing for my wounds, and refreshment for my hungry perishing Soul? Lord, I now beg it as earnestly, as if I were presently dying and appearing before thee. I am sorry I have trifl'd so long, now I am willing, I am resolv'd, to be wholly thine, always thine.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Go to Christ for help and deliverance; he came to seek and to save that which was lost and undone, dead and perishing eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally: He lost himself to save you, died himself, that you might live. Now you must come to Christ not only for comfort and
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:94151:130"/> pardon, and joy in being safe and sound; but for Grace and Wisdom, and Strength to be made sound and whole. It's he is made Wisdom to us, that we may not live and die fools, and he is made sanctification as well as righteousness. Christ calls you to come, though miserable, and lost and sinking; nay, because you are so, the fitter to come in to his arms of Mercy: He is able to save thee to the uttermost; you have heard, you can destroy your selves, but can't save your selves; you can wound, but Christ alone can heal those deep ghastly wounds that sin hath made; he was made a curse for us, that we might be blessed. Christ is not priz'd, studied, believ'd, glorified in, as he deserves: How few, as the Apostle, desire to glory in nothing else, and account all else, but dung and dross? When we have done all, and followed the former directions to our best skill and utmost power, we must throw our selves upon <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> or we shall perish. The Apostle, so good a Man, found himself utterly lost, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.24. and therefore <hi>v.</hi> 25. thanks God for <hi>Jesus Christ;</hi> let others boast of their works, glory in their merits; when I consider, how little good I do, and how much evil I fall into daily, I need a Christ. How many sinful vain thoughts in a day, to any serious Heavenly Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? How many idle unnecessary words to a little serious Heavenly discourse? How little good I do in a day to what I might, and that
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:94151:130"/> I do with so little delight? and on the other hand, when I consider how great Christs love was, how large Gods bounty is; how glorious and great Heaven will be; I must utterly despair, were it not for <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> my dear Saviour; all my Life, every breath of it, is by him, who loved me and gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, for me. Some trust in Chariots and some in Horses, some in their Zeal, others in their Strength, some in their Charity, some in their Piety and Devotion; but we will remember the name and merits of Christ our Saviour; when they are brought down and fallen, we may rise and stand upright.</p>
               <p>Direct. 7. <hi>Be not discourag'd because of the danger and difficulty, were it much more, you were better strive against it than be damn'd; but for your great encouragement, the way is easie, the work pleasant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God condescends wonderfully, to save the lowest, the meanest: Were there such a Proclamation, as <hi>Isa.</hi> 55.1, 2. in al Fair or Market, what thronging would there be, come without Mony and without Price? There are many rich and necessary things in Fairs and Shops, but the poor go not thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, because they have not Mony to buy; but were all free for fetching and asking, what running, striving and thronging would there be? Why should you be discouraged? have there not as great and vile sinners as you, been sav'd? What was <hi>Manasses?</hi> he was an

What was <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> and many others? besides, what mean and inconsiderable persons were sav'd by Christ? the poor Woman of <hi>Caanan,</hi> the Woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> the <hi>Publican,</hi> the blind beggar by the ways side; and in these, what was emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent or remarkable to commend them to God, but their misery and want, and a deep sense of it, and highly prizing their salvation. Would you not account it an unspeakable mercy, if God would pity and heal, help and save you? What is there more to commend us to Gods pity and Grace? What was there in the poor Widows Mite, but gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving up her All with good will and delight. A cup of cold water given in sincerity; the poor Womans pains and teares,<note place="margin">

Be not discourag'd, God will enable you, Christ will assist you, the Spirit will strengthen, teach and guide you, if you are willing to be sav'd, God will meet you, as the Father the Prodigal, and he will cloath you, and feed you and save you; all is ready for your Life and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Father doth not say, stand off,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:94151:131"/> Son, keep without door, I will first try your obedience, first humble you, you must be more sham'd and confounded, the smell of the Swine and Husks is yet upon you; no, immediately in his arms, kiss'd him, calls for the Robe, the Ring, the fatted Calf; who would not come to such a Heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be sav'd? he will entertain you so readily, so richly, so lovingly; and his work is easie and pleasant, it's but to love, fear and honour him, and you love your selves and save your own Souls. You love Life, and Light and Salvation, and unspeakable Happiness. The work may be done with great ease and delight; come, taste and see, come and try; it's your distance, your ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, your prejudice, that makes it seem hard and troublesome; experience will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince you of your mistake. Said one, I lov'd thee late, Lord, the greater is my sin, and the more my grief. Want of a serious Heavenly Spirit makes Gods work heavy and tiresome. Once pray with earnestness, and hope, and desire and love, and then 'twill be sweet and blessed work. 'Twas love made <hi>David</hi> say, one day in thy Courts is better than a Thousand elsewhere; many are ready to say, one day in the World is better than a thousand in Gods Work. Did you know the blessings and comforts of these Heavenly frames, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.2 to 11. the sweet of a poor Spirit, of a meek soft Heart, of a pure Heart, of being merciful; how would you
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:94151:132"/> prize them above pride and passion, and cruelty and discontent? observe</p>
               <p n="1">1. That all these Blessings are spiritual; not blessed are the Rich, or the Wise, or the Mighty, but the Poor, the Meek, the Mourners.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That all the promises made to them are spiritual also; not yours is the Glory of the World, but yours is the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; not Blessed, they shall have riches and pleasures, but they shall see God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That these qualifications are low and condescending, take in the meanest and lowest Christian, that is sincere.</p>
               <p>It is not, Blessed are the rich and strong in Grace, but the poor in spirit, such as are mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serably poor and empty, and needy and low, and vile in their own eyes, that want all Grace, and come so to Christ. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.17, 18.</p>
               <p>It is not, Blessed are they only, that rejoyce in ways of righteousness, and have great comfort and peace in believing; but Blessed are they that mourn for sin, and weep that they can do no more, no better, that bewail their deadness and unprofitableness.</p>
               <p>Not only, Blessed are the high-bearing, courageous, bold Christians; but Blessed are the meek, soft, quiet spirits, that are meek under Gods chastisement, reproofs and
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:94151:132"/> Word, and are mild and gentle towards Men.</p>
               <p>Not only, Blessed are the full and those that tast marrow and fatness, and sweetness in Duties and Gods Ordinances; that have large incomes of Grace and Comfort, but also, Blessed are the hungry and thirsty; that are needy, pinching and wanting, and crave and cry after food and refreshment; and this takes in any Babes in Christs Family.</p>
               <p>Not only, Blessed are those that can give and do great things to and for us, but, Blessed are those that are of a tender merciful spirit, full of bowels, and compassion and kindness. Thus, many shall be rewarded at the last for feeding the hungry, clothing the naked,<note place="margin">

               <p>Not, Blessed only are those that are pure and unblameable in their Lives, but, Blessed if pure in Heart, that desire purity from the very bottom of their Hearts.</p>
               <p>Not only, Blessed are those that live peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably with all Men; that is not possible, but, Blessed, if desire and attempt it, and are willing to be peace-makers; are of peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, quiet, spirits and are willing others should be so to.</p>
               <p>Not only, Blessed are those that are eminent in service, and do much good for God in their places; but, Blessed also are they, that can suffer patiently and comfortably for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness sake. As the good Woman said,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:94151:133"/> though she could not dispute for Christ, she could die for Christ. I know not, but God may graciously accept, and publickly own some at last, in willingly suffering for Christs sake and the Gospel,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.12. Ch. 3.12.</note> that never did much more before for God, it may be against him. To suffer is a great gift, as well as to believe.</p>

How Blessed the Man, that is good and really sav'd; there is a Blessing for every qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification, Grace and Duty; Blessed as hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as merciful; Blessed praying, and Blessed believing; and with what delight does Christ make such happy, that so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces it at every Grace?</p>
               <p n="5">5. God and Christ know whom they bless, do not cast them forth at randome; he Blesseth none, but such as are capable of receiving those Blessings.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Then they must be Cursed that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; then Cursed are the proud in spirit, Cursed they, that laugh at and in sin.</p>

               <p>Cursed are they, that are full and loath the Hony-comb, and slight the Feast of fat things; they shall hunger and thirst in pain, and gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping

               <p>Cursed are the brawlers and fire-brands, and makebates, they shall be called the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Devil.</p>
               <p>Cursed be they that leave Christ, and will not suffer but sin, for theirs is Hell; they may weep and roar, for great is their wrath and misery in Hell.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Gods Blessings on the Soul are real, sure and refreshing; it is not, they may be Blessed, but they shall be comforted, they shall see God, they shall obtain Mercy; it is not only be ye warmed, and cloth'd and fill'd, but they shall be fill'd, they shall find and feel it.</p>
               <p n="9">9. How different Gods Blessings are from the Worlds Blessings; they say, Blessed are the rich, and they that are high, proud and stout, and they that are full, and they that are freed from sufferings; they are ready to say, God Bless us from these kind of Blessings, but God knows best, what is really good and what not.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The lowest, the meanest, the poorest condition, nor the greatest sufferings, can make one really good; and thus blest by God, yet miserable and wretched.</p>
               <p>On the whole you may see, that it's not so difficult a work to be truly good and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally

               </head>
               <p>UPon the whole, you cannot doubt of the certainty of this happiness; all your care and work is to see that you are Children, and espous'd to Christ, and you need not doubt of this salvation. But after all that hath been written to persuade you, unless God open your Eyes, change your Hearts, and undeceive you, you will follow your own vain imaginations, and be undone; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I and you too must turn to God in prayer, and earnestly beg his blessing and assistence, and all will be well. The Lord make it effectual to some Souls, and why should not you that are reading it, say, Lord, let it be so to my Soul, that I may not perish to all Eternity.</p>
               <p>And above all, look to it, and be sure that you are really good, sound at Heart, and such as may be receiv'd to Glory. Though a Man is not so much concern'd and thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, whether a shilling he takes be brass, yet is he careful that his Writings be right, and his Title to his Estate good, and his Life, when in danger, be sav'd. A Man puts all his Children and Servants out of the room, that he may not be disturb'd, when about
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:94151:139"/> his Writings and great settlements; lay aside all other matters and business, when this great work is in hand; and be not satisfied nor quiet, till you can truly say, Lord, thou that knowest all things, knowest that I love thee, and you rejoyce in hope of the Glory to come: God hath done and said much, to secure this happiness for and to you; and should not you make it the solemn and whole business of your Lives, to secure this to your own Souls?</p>
               <p>To shut up the whole, I may set before you many things of great concernment, that may be worthy your serious consideration and meditation, but should I reduce them to so many Topicks, the Book would increase upon me too much. I shall only address my self to all sorts of persons, and speak of many things useful, though of a different Nature, that some one thing or other may reach all persons of different constitutions and persuasions.</p>
               <p>I could write much unto you, young ones and Children, and earnestly beg you, young Men and Women, to be wise in your young and tender years, to prevent this dreadful deceit and destruction. I have often despair'd of dealing with the Aged, the old weather-beaten sinner,<note place="margin">

Therefore in all my Ministry, my Heart was much carried out, and my bowels yearn'd towards young and tender ones, hoping some good might be done amongst them. You are now in your tender years, more pliable and yielding, more ready to hear; sin hath not made such a deep impression, nor had such a long possession; you have not so many wounds, bruises, and falls to be recover'd; you have not sinn'd against so much light, refus'd so many calls, as elder persons; God expects your younger years, and you must give an account for these years, and the works and words thereof. Rejoyce, O young Man,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eccles.</hi> 11, 9.</note> and be merry, but know thou, that for these things, God will bring thee into judgement; therefore, remove sorrow, and prevent mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery. Now is the acceptable time to the Lord, he delights in the first fruits, the young Pidgeons, and the young Lambs, he remembers the kindness of the youth. Usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally such as begin betimes, are more eminent for grace and comforts than others. Those that are bred up to work and a calling from their infancy, lay up in store for old age; it's hard to be bound Apprentice at thirty, or forty, or fifty years old; whereas, train'd up to the work, it's nothing to you. Hard and strange to bring old people to pray, to hear
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:94151:140"/> with delight, and love the Word, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of good things, that were never us'd to it.

One on a death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed told me with great sorrow and anguish, as the Soul was going out of the body, <hi>I had convictions in my younger years, and lost them, and could never recover them again.</hi> Now is a time of leisure, you are not plung'd in the cares, and labours, and snares of the World; now you had need be more watchful, because

Should your days continue, the day of Grace may be gone, you may lose precious advantages for your Souls, Heavenly Calls, and able Ministers; your Sun may set at noon; it may be you may never hear more so many awak'ning truths, if you lose these; God may take away the means of Grace, but will never take away the Grace got by the means; but should you hear as many more blessed truths, and gracious invitations, and wholsome counsels; you may not have the strivings of the spirit; and you are as likely, nay more, to sin away them, as you do these: If you think you shall be better here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, observe your Parents, or other aged
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:94151:141"/> persons, and see whether they be not as worldly, sensual, and slothful, in Heavenly work, and as far from Death and Judgement, in their thoughts and preparation, as you. God would have you seek first his Kingdom, and remember your Creatour in your youth, and he knows what is best; this is the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of your whole lives. Why should God and Heaven have only the dry bones, and dim eyes, and staggering limbs, and feeble knees;<note place="margin">Ubi con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumpsisti furfurem, ibi fari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam.</note> and sin and vanity have the flower, the strength and marrow? Take heed of those sins now, that will rot your bones, and make your Souls roar in old age, if you live so long.</p>
               <p>You that are Aged and Fathers, will you yet hear and be wise? you have one foot in the Grave, and the other in Hell, and both in Sin; have you liv'd all these days destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your selves, and heaping up wrath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the day of wrath? have you been quite out of the way; and are weakness and decays coming upon you, gray hairs here and there? do you perceive it? why may you not yet be wise? some came at the 11th. hour, and were receiv'd and rewarded. Away with your old courses, customs, and sins, and say yet, why should I not yet turn and live? When Sin and the World call for more of thy time, say, have you not had enough and too much already? I have but a little left, and if I give you this, you have all, and then I am utterly undone. Well, yet you are in
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:94151:141"/> the land of the Living: It is not your old, and great, and many sins, will hinder Mercy, but impenitency, want of tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and brokenness, and this you must beg of God.</p>
               <p>You that are Great, and Rich, and Mighty, will you be convinc'd, that your greatest Portion in this World is but poor, base, and beggarly, to what I offer you? Can a Man be poorer than Death will make him, stript of all? When a covetous greedy wretch cries out at last, What, World, wilt thou not afford me a Corner, a Chamber, a Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set, a Dungeon, a little Bread and Water? no, kick him out of doors, cast him into the Grave, let him stink and rot, and leave all here to others.</p>
               <p>Ay, but I have rose early, gone to bed late, eat the bread of sorrow and careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; I have desir'd thy favour, fear'd thine anger, World, more than the wrath of God. I have admir'd thy favourites, though I could not reach to it my self, I have worship'd the rising Sun; and I have despis'd thy poor, ragged, miserable Mourners; I have run, and rid, sweat, and pinch'd my bowels, wearied out my limbs, and all to get a little of thee: Nay, I have slighted God, neglected his Word and Work; when I should have been at prayer in the Morning for my Soul, I have hearken'd to thy call, and run abroad to my field, or to my shop, or to my games, seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for thy pleasure and profit, and have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:94151:142"/> it above Godliness; and I have tir'd my self about thy work all the day, so that I have neglected God and my Soul at night; I have laught at, and despis'd those in my Heart, that did mind reading and prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when I was getting mony, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and now God hath forsaken me and is angry, my Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence galls and terrifies me, and wilt thou also cast me off?

Are you Masters and Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresses? do not domineer and insult, and wrong your Servants, knowing that you have a Master in Heaven; wrong them not in their Wages, nor work, their cries come up to God; oppress not the poor, not hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, nor needy; your account is coming, and wrath on your Souls. <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.1, 2.

There is none here to call you to an account.</p>
               <p>Are you Magistrates and Governours? how exact, and vigilant, and wise, should you be?</p>
               <p>Are you Ministers? what a great account must you give for your selves, and the Souls committed to your charge? If the Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man sleep, it's worse than another, that should give warning, and prevent fire or an enemy; if the Fountain be poyson'd or corrupt, how the streams? what great guilt to destroy so many? A Lawyer offends, that neglects his care, and makes false settlement, and undoes his Client; a Physician that neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:94151:144"/> his Patient, and prescribes Poyson for Physick, and kills the Body; but a Minister much more, that neglects Souls, and gives Scorpions for Fish, and Serpents for Bread. O the price of Souls!</p>
               <p>A Physician could scarce earn his Pay or Livelyhood, that only read a Lecture once a week in a Parish or a publick place, and learnedly discours'd of the nature of a Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor, a Consumption, or Apoplexy, shew'd the causes, the symptomes, and the cure; the people would be unwilling to give him an 100 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> nor account themselves much benefited by him, unless he came to their Houses, enquir'd into their Distempers, felt their Pulses, found how their Head ak'd, or Bowels, grip'd, apply'd suitable Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, see that they took it, and observ'd the result. The truth is, a Physician would be starv'd for all his plush Coat; and a Lawyer, for all his great House, if they did not study, and were careful and successful, persons would give them nothing. But a Minister, Preach or not Preach, see his people or live an 100 Miles off, and laugh at them, goes to the Law for his Tythes; feeds himself though the people starves; but such wretches starve, wound, and destroy themselves most.

               <p>How many useful Inferences may be drawn from the whole?</p>
               <p>Then they are not the wise and happy, that the World account so, but whom God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts so. A man may be rich, and yet mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serably poor; living and lively, and yet dreadfully dying; high and honourable, and yet base and vile; wise and learned, and yet a very fool; confident and presumptious, and yet on the brink of Destruction.</p>
               <p>Then, no wonder good men are so cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and wary, so fearful and enquiring, doubting and sinking, you can't blame them, they are afraid of being undone: Let them search and try, pray and cry, run and fight, it's for their Lives. You blame not the Worldlings, for their care and diligence, their wisdom and labour; they are accounted wise, and take their Seasons; they do not neglect Sowing till they should Reap; no, rise at Night to Plow, when they should sleep.</p>
               <p>Blame not good men, if they take all the best Seasons, it's their wisdom, their safety, their happiness, that they take their younger years, greedily catch after all seasons of Grace; take the time, when they have strength, and their Hearts best in frame.</p>
               <p>No wonder they prize that Company, those Ministers best, that will help them against this deceit; glad to have the most searching, awakening Word, willing that the Word should search the bottom of the Wound, though it puts them to pain and smarting.</p>
               <pb n="273" facs="tcp:94151:145"/>
               <p>Hence 'tis, they are more afraid of the least sin, than the greatest suffering; that they cannot, dare not, do as others, though re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd, scorn'd, persecuted; they think it strange, but these know, there is great danger in the least sin, it wounds to the Heart, and wounds Eternally.</p>
               <p>Therefore these prize pardoning Mercy, Free-Grace, <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> and wonderfully extoll and exalt it; they can't enough glory in <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> and him Crucified, as their Saviour.</p>
               <p>Therefore are they so contented with the least allowance, and the greatest troubles. These things are not my portion, nor these losses my Hell. Strike Lord, strike,<note place="margin">Feri, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, feri, <hi>&amp;c. Luther.</hi>
                  </note> my sins are pardon'd, <hi>Isa.</hi> 33.24. they shall not say they are sick, he doth not say, they are not sick; but they shall not regard it; why? their iniquities are forgiven.</p>
               <p>Therefore are they often so willing to die, long to be dissolv'd, because they know, it's far better.</p>
               <p>If so many be deceiv'd, and the danger so great, then salvation-work is not easie, trifling, common work, as the most make it. Certainly it's hard to escape all the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous snares, there is somewhat to take with these wicked Hearts; we can't enough watch against our selves, and bewail our own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful Hearts. No wonder, good men so much bewail their evil Natures; there is a snare in every thing, in our meat, and drink,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:94151:146"/> and sleep, in our prayers and hearing, in our converse and solitude, when lifted up, proud; when cast down, murmur; when far off from Death, severe; when draw nigh, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm'd and confounded. The Devil knows how to bait for every temper, he knows your constitutions; if proud, he sets before you your abilities, your esteem in the World, and it may be more than it is, and your good works; if covetous, he proposes gain, and much increase this and that way, and it may be upon others; if melancholly, he will drive to sadness and despair; if chearful, to wantonness and gayety; if alone, he tempts to vain thoughts; if in company, to vain discourse; if your enemies before you, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke you to hate or hurt them; if your friends, to love them over much, to flatter and applaud them; if you are lazy, and sloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and careless about Religion, keep you from Prayer, hearing or reading; if you are inclin'd to hear or pray, tempt you to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality and coldness, or to hypocrisie and vain-glory: Are you careless, presumptious, and confident of your spiritual condition? he says, all is well, never fear; are you fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and doubting? he tells you there is no hope, no help for you. Thus the adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary useth all means to destroy, and we close in with all his Temptations, and hurt our selves.</p>
               <p>Now you hear a Sermon but once a week, read a Chapter now and then, meet with
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:94151:146"/> good company, and discourse seldom; but these tempters and temptations are with you lying down and rising up, in all places, company, and conditions.</p>
               <p>Learn hence, that it is an unspeakable mercy, astonishing goodness, the mighty power and wisdom of God, if a Soul be sav'd and deliver'd. Heaven is but enough to admire, praise and magnifie this distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Grace and Goodness. When a Soul shall see at last, how she escap'd such a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous snare; deliver'd this and that way, and when escape from every Temptation.</p>
               <p>The Lord only knows how, <hi>quid, quando, quomodo;</hi> what is the best means, time, and way, to deliver the Godly out of Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation?</p>
               <p>On the other hand, how sad and doleful the condition of every wicked Man, every lost Soul, that runs on to destruction; he knows also how to reserve the unjust to the day of Judgement, to be punish'd.<note place="margin">2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9.</note>

               <p>Another says, call upon God: Alas! said a sinner under agonies to me, how dare you speak to God for me, that have been all my days so vile? I foresaw all this wrath and misery long ago; I call'd my Soul to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and told it all this, how't would be; O! that I could be a warning to all others; if God will damn, cast me off, he is just and righteous, I have nothing to say; if he will save me, 'twil be unspeakable Mercy. I know all send for a Minister to speak com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably to the dying, good or bad. A Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician may tell them, the Patient is thus and thus sick, and when dangerous; but a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister must say, all is well, chear up. But God bids us say only to the Righteous, it shall be well with them, and to the wicked, woe; and Christ says, if the house be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, peace shall abide, and if not, go away.</p>
               <p>It is not in the power of all the Angels in Heaven, nor the best Ministers on earth, to speak peace to a wicked man dying; <hi>There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked;</hi>

What shall we say to one, that hath liv'd in sensuality, pride, and wantonness, in drunkenness, and intemperance, in neglect of God and all that is good, in contempt of his word and works, that hath serv'd the Devil, his Lusts, and the World, all his days, that never pray'd one quarter of an hour hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:94151:148"/> nor read the Word with any delight? shall we say to such a one, <hi>well done, good and faithful servant, you have been abounding in the work of the Lord, you have fought a good fight, you have pray'd without ceasing, you have been faithful to God, to your Neighbours and your own Soul?</hi> would the person believe us, or rather think we jear him? Ay, but he is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent and very sorry for his sins, and cries to God for Mercy. It's well, if it be sincere; you, his friends, are willing to believe so, so you are that he will live again, though he be just dying, he must not be told of it; but is it any token that I have a great love and kindness for you, because I run under your roof for shelter, when a dreadful storm is ready to swallow me up? All I shall say, is, that I have found some to appearance near Death, very penitent and good, full of hearty resolutions and promises, that have reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd, and turn'd as bad, or worse than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; as strength came, so corruptions grew; that I have very little charity for a Death-bed Repentance.</p>
               <p>I know the Thief on the Cross is the grand and only instance made use of, not to bring to Repentance, but to keep men from it till that very time, and that hath brought many a Thief to the Gallows. That was an extraordinary instance; he was wonderfully wrought upon, and chang'd: To own a Christ upon the Cross, when others were buffeting, and spitting on his blessed face,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:94151:148"/> upbraiding, and saying, <hi>save thy self;</hi> and at this time to reprove his fellow Thief, to confess his own fault; to acknowledge and own Christ to be Lord, to own him to be a Saviour of the World, that was dying him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, a cruel, and cursed, and shameful Death; to own him as one that could save such a a great, vile, and cursed Sinner as he was, that men would not save; nay, to own a Kingdom, a Crown, for him that was nail'd to the Cross; and that he was willing to go and be with him, for all that shame and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt; besides you can't expect such an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, the Saviour of the World would shew now at his Death, that he was a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of Sinners, and would carry one with him from the Cross to his Crown. The other Thief was not sav'd by him, though he died on the other side, so near Christ. It's likely, this may be his first call, you have refus'd many. The reasons why persons are so willing to plead this way, is, because they would have this World while they can, and pass into Heaven at last. Do not thus deceive, and flatter, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy your selves.</p>
               <p>Again, why do, you trifle, and are most careless, that little time you spend in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly work. God allows you much time about the World, six days in seven, and the seventh the World hath usually; and if you pray or read, then dead, dull, sleepy; alive
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:94151:149"/> about the World all day, work and talk, and not weary nor complain. Should a man allow his servant all the day for his eating and drinking, and his own work, only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire an hour in the day for his proper and immediate service, he must needs be highly offended to find him sleeping and trifling then? God allows you much time, almost all the day and night for your eating, and drinking, and sleeping, and worldly works, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights; and will you, dare you, trifle that little short hour in a day at your prayers?</p>
               <p>Methinks, I am loth to believe you unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd and quiet in your lost undone condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; I leave it to you to debate the business with your own Souls. Say, I have lost much time already, never to be recall'd; I have but a little time more to enjoy what now I seem to have in Possession.</p>
               <p>I have but a little time more to debate the business, and to resolve, whether I shall be sav'd or perish. Death is at hand, and that is the trap-door, that will let me into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or Hell. Many of my friends and acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance are gone already; I see good and bad men hasten away, Heaven and Hell fill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pace every day; when they are gone, you hear no more of them, and therefore are secure.</p>
               <p>May I not do this Heavenly work, and enjoy as much as I do of the World still? Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this is true, that there is such an happiness or misery, or not? if it be not true, I see
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:94151:149"/> not but such as pray, as mediate, and walk circumspectly, live as comfortably as we do, that neglect all this Heavenly work, and run into sin, and on this account, they are in as happy condition as we; but if this be true, woe, woe to me that ever I was born; 'twould have been well for me that I had been a Toad, a Dog, and could perish as they; better have the Heart of a Swine, than of a man, and not love God. My Horse, and my Ox and Sheep, will rise up in Judgement against me, they work and serve me, seem delighted and thankful, when I bring them Fodder and own them;<note place="margin">

Alas! alas! what have I done? what will become of me? What account can I give for Sermons or good Books, and good examples; good Bread, and Drink, and Meat, and have been unthankful and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful? How may I sit down and mourn alone, and refuse to be comforted? I am undone, I am lost, I am certainly hastning a-pace to Eternal Destruction. Well, is it impossible, that I may yet recover, is their no hope, no help, for such a lost sinner as I am? Did not Christ come to seek and save that which was lost? why should I not turn and live? O, that yet I may be accepted. God
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:94151:150"/> calls me, Christ intreats me. This Treatise is now sent me, to persuade, and intreat me to turn to the Lord, and seek for Mercy and live. I come, Lord, at thy call and command, I cast away my Rebellious Arms; I give up my self to thy Government.

               </head>
               <p>BY the more general <hi>Conclusion,</hi> you may see that the deceit is Universal, an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidemical Disease; that most see it in others, few in themselves; most censure and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn others, few judge and condemn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and so will be judg'd and condemn'd of the Lord; you see, that all without me is nothing to me, unless I am good myself, though God is never so good and gracious in himself, and to others, yet is he a dreadful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying enemy to me; though Christ is a precious Saviour to others, yet a terrible judge and destroyer to me; though the Bible be full of Grace, Mercy, and Truth, there is not one comfortable Word to me; though my Father and Mother be kind and tender, my Wife loving, my Children sweet, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, and obedient; yet all of them can't help to save me; though I have heard many good Sermons, read many good Books, been in much good company, yet all have done me no good, but I am more wicked and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable in sinning against such Light; though I have pretended to put up many Prayers, made a large Profession, seem'd to others good and Godly, yet my Heart was not
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:94151:151"/> right with God, I did but dissemble, and I am utterly undone. As for outward endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments &amp; accomplishments, my reason and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding I did not employ about the best objects, to the highest ends; my Tongue I may bite in peices, and spit with indignation out of my Mouth, that hath spoken idly, vainly, and wickedly, so long, and little or nothing to Gods Glory, the good of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and mine own comfort; my strength and beauty, I have boasted of; my Clothes and outward Ornaments, I have been proud of, though others have despis'd me, when I thought they admir'd me, or rather my Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel; and besides, was it never so rich and gaudy, 'twas forgotten in a year or two af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward; and now all is gone; and such a rich Feast, a twelve-month past yields not the least relish and savour in my thoughts now. Had I fed the poor, cloath'd the naked, out of true pity and tenderness to them, and love to God then had it been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable in the review. I have pleas'd my self still in what was to come, in prospect of future happiness, when young, in a Married condition; when Married, in my Children; when grown up, in their well-matching, and so in their Children. But I see this is still all somewhat without me, and besides my self. I have seen the most and best of the World, and what it can do for me; it's like, I may never eat, and drink, and sleep, with that pleasure I have, any more,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:94151:152"/> my later days may be fill'd with sorrow, pains, and decays. Many of those that did laugh, and eat, and drink with me, have been rotting in the Grave some years, what is become of their Souls, I know not: God hath yet prolong'd my days to this moment, this may be my last call and warning; and within a day or two, a week, a month, a year, others may think and talk of me, as I do of others now; why may I not now cast off other matters, and sit down and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, what I am, what I have done, whither I am going; how 'tis with me at present, and how it's like to be with me very shortly?</p>
               <p>I may verily conclude, I am not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue here as now I am; where is the Man or Woman that lives always? It's true, Men are immortal in their thoughts, that is, they rarely, or never come to a determinate time, to think I must now die; let a Man be old or weak, he thinks I shall live this day, and to morrow, and when that comes, he still accounts upon the next day, and friends still hope, till they gasp and breath out the last; nay, some pull and rub them when dead, and feign would bring to Life again, and when no hope, cry out in anguish, what, dead? what, dead? What, speak no more to me, see me no more? no, Hands off, Heart off, he is gone, past recovery, when God strikes, he strikes home, no rising after his blow.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.39.</note> See now, that I, even I am he, and there is no God with me; I kill, and I make
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:94151:152"/> alive; I wound, and I heal, neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand. I lift up my hand to Heaven, and say, I live for ever; if I whet my glittering Sword, and mine hand take hold on judgement, <hi>Psal.</hi> 90.3. <hi>Thou turnest Man to Destruction: and sayest, Return, ye Children of Men.</hi> Some would have it, return to the dust, man, from whence thou camest; but others, spoken ironically, return again to thy House and Family, to thy Life and Health again, if thou can'st; try, whether thou can'st get out of my hands. Thou carriest them as with a Flood, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleep; as Grass, flourish in morning, and wither at night; who knows thy power, according to our fear of thee it is, and much more? So teach us to number our days, that we may be truly wise, not that we can number any; but that they are not to be accounted upon at all; <hi>Psal.</hi> 39.4. <hi>Lord, make me to know my end, and the measure of my days,</hi> that is, <hi>how frail I am.</hi> It's very hard to live under a believing sense of it, that I shall die.</p>
               <p>I may certainly conclude, that here is no abiding place for me, let me cleave to the World never so close and fast, I must knock off, my house will cast me out. How happy and Blessed may I be in ways of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness? how comfortable, living and dying? what manner of person shall I be, if I come to Glory? in how little time may I be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Saints and Angels? and what manner
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:94151:153"/> of person should I now be, in all holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation and godliness? why may not I come to Heaven, as well as others?</p>
               <p>How dreadfully miserable shall I be, if I perish, and am undone at last; am I not on the brink of Heaven or Hell? Death is the clap-door, once my Soul is gone out of my Body; there is no change, nor alteration, no recovery, any more: And shall I thus go on from day to day, and never bring it to an head, to some result, whether I am like to be sav'd, or perish Eternally? I have been convinc'd often, awaken'd and startl'd; I have had frightful thoughts in my Dreams, fear'd I have been falling down a deep pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipice, or some ghastly enemies were laying hold of me, and no friend nigh, and I strive to call and cry, and could not cry out; I have often been terrified at an awak'ning Sermon, but all did wear off again; I have been sometimes sick, and near death, and have promis'd, if God would spare me, I would certainly lead another course of Life, refrain such and such sins, yea, all sin, and perform such duties daily and fervent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. But my wicked Heart hath deceiv'd and undone me, and I fear will be too hard for me to my dying day. My condition is dangerous, if not desperate. Well, I may admire Gods goodness that I am yet alive, that yet I can speak, and hear, and see, that God hath not long since put out these eyes that have seen so much va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:94151:153"/> and so seldom seen him in his word and works; that he hath not strook me dumb, that have us'd my Tongue so little to his praise and glory; that he hath not strook me dead long since, that have liv'd so unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably, nay, so provokingly. Yet I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, once more I have this call and warning, who knows, but God hath thoughts of mercy to my Soul? if he would have destroy'd me, he might have done it long ago; why should I not lye groveling in the dust,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Jon.</hi> 3.8, 9</note> be cover'd with sackcloth and ashes, fall down in tears and anguish, cry mightily unto God, turn from my wickedness? who can tell, but God may turn from his fierce anger, and I perish not? Why may not this time be a time of love? but then I must do it presently; if I put it off till to morrow, I shall then till ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther day; I have been caught too often in that snare already; why should I not shut my self up from all company and diversions, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to be comforted or call'd off? I know, as soon as I go to private Prayer in my Closet, though there be no body knocks at door, the World and other matters knock at my Heart, and call me off presently; I could never abide quietly at it, till I brought it to some good pass.</p>
               <p>Well, I am resolv'd to hold my self to it, my Body at least I can shut up, and shut in; my Heart will run away, I will call in Gods assistence, who alone can command this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:94151:154"/> wandring Heart; as it is said, who can know it? I the Lord search it: So, who can rule and mend it? none but God. I never yet could promise of my self to stick to it one hour or two, much less one day; and this is the main business of my Life. I am now resolv'd, nothing shall hinder me; I have spent days and hours enough about the World and vanity, the time past may suffice, and is too much, that I have walked after the course of this Word. I will now give up my self to this great and solemn work I know, I shall have excuses and delays, now is not a fit time, I can't be private, or I have other matters, such expect ye; the Devil, the World, and your Hearts, will find you out somewhat. No, i'le hearken to them no more; no, this is the time, I will take another time for that: Ay, but then let half an hour serve; no, I will have half the day, all the day, and all the night, and to morrow too; if I can't finish it, I will now bring it to some good issue, if possible. This will be too grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous and troublesome to flesh and blood, to thy Body and thy Friends; I have been kind enough, too kind to them already; what can't they be satisfied, unless I destroy Body and Soul for them, to please and serve them? why should this seem so much and grievous? I can fast a whole day for the Health of my Body, and take griping and bitter Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick; and do I not need Vomits for my foul Stomach, and sharp Physick for my Soul? I
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:94151:154"/> can attend my Husband or Child, if sick, and dying, and not eat day after day, nor sleep in the night, watch and cry, watch and strive, and think no pains too much; and shall I not now cry, and watch; weep and pray for my poor Soul, my precious and immortal Soul? I can't save my Husband or Child from Death, but my Soul may be sav'd from Everlasting Death. I can deny my self food and comforts a long time, when my dear friend is dead, weep over the Grave, think and talk of him night and day; and what, shall I spend no time to bewail my dead Soul estrang'd from God, without hope, without Christ and God, in this World, and will, if not timely prevented, be without them for ever? I can deny my self food, and ease, and sleep, in following the World, if riding Journy's, if getting Mony in Market, or Fairs, if selling an Estate, if entring on a great, hopeful, and gainful Voyage; not mind meat or drink a day together, scarce sleep in the night, rise early in the morning, work hard all the day, and not begrudge my pains, if get but small matters; and shall I not set to this work heartily; when I may do it alone without others assistence, and do it thorowly, and get far greater Mercy, and on better terms, and all made sure to my Soul?</p>
               <p>I can deny my self food and ease, at my pleasures and sports; ride all day in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:94151:155"/> my Game, sit up all night at Cards and Dice, unwearied in attending on Plays, pleas'd hours in reading Romances; and if lower in the World, I have spent days and hours in sports and recreations, and shall I begrudge one day, or two days, about a busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of such concernment?</p>
               <p>I have spent many days and weeks in ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving my friends, in advising and assisting others, and was never so kind to my self, as to spend one solemn day thus about my self.</p>
               <p>I have spent Months and Years about my House, my Grounds, my Cattle, my Mony; and never yet set apart one week about my Soul, my Self; I have spent many hours at Prayer, Reading, Hearing, Sabbaths, Fasts, and Sacraments, till I was quite weary in performing the outside Service, but never yet searcht my Soul to purpose, whether I have got any real good.</p>
               <p>God, in his providence, hath made me lye on a sick Bed, or brought me under great troubles and losses, and made me fast, and weep, and groan, nights and days, and may yet cast me under many more; and were I not better willingly choose to fast, and weep, search, and cry, because of my sins, and I may prevent such doleful nights and days? My friends, if good, and Ministers, have wept
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:94151:155"/> and pray'd, and God hath waited a long time, and call'd, and his spirit hath been griev'd, and I not yet grieve and mourn in secret.</p>
               <p>I must, whether I will or no, very shortly lye days and nights under the Earth, and not eat nor drink, nor enjoy this World months and years, yea, no more; and shall I think it much to deny my self a few days and nights, and may hereby prevent Everlasting roarings and yellings, pains, and horror, for ever? If I sow in Tears a little while, I may reap an Harvest of joy; my worldly grieving for friends have done no good, but increase my sorrows, and work Death; but this godly sorrow may make way for Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting joys. Shall I lye in the Grave scores and thousands of years, and not descend in my thoughts, and dwell there one day or night together?</p>
               <p>Had I done it sooner, might it not have prevented the loss of much precious time, many blessed seasons, prepar'd me for sore trials, and made all conditions good to me?</p>
               <p>Well, yet I have this time, I must not, I will not, I cannot lose it. I will hearken to the Flesh, to the Devil, to the World, no longer, no more.</p>
               <pb n="294" facs="tcp:94151:156"/>
               <p>Now fixing on the time, setting it apart with full resolution, I will set to the work heartily, and perform it thorowly; I will search, and search again, and know, how matters stand betwixt God and my Soul. If, upon serious enquiry, I find that all is out of order, and my Soul is in a sad, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing condition; all the World shall not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie and quiet me. What if I have health and ease, and riches, and friends at present, these can't help, nor comfort, nor divert me much longer. None but Christ, nothing but pardon, can satisfie my Conscience, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort my Soul, nor make me truly happy. Why may not Christ be my Saviour, my help, my salvation? Give me Christ, or else I die, and that Eternally. I am not excepted in the calls of the Gospel, in the offers of Mercy. I am willing to come in, and give up my self wholly to God. Here is Head, Heart, Soul and Body, Tongue, and Life, all at thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and dispose. I have wearied my self for very vanity, and mistook my main busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and errand, in this World. O Lord, thou hast no pleasure in my Death, but hadst rather I would turn and live; turn me, O Lord, and I shall be turn'd: It's thine own work, work in me both to will and to do of thine own good pleasure. I not only en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage thus upon present convictions and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakenings, but I resolve in full purpose of Soul, to cleave to Thee all my days, keep it ever in the purpose of my Heart. I must go
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:94151:156"/> down into the World again with my Body, but, Lord, keep my Heart still with Thee; keep me by Thy Almighty power, thorow Faith unto Salvation; never leave nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake me, and put Thy fear into my Heart, that I may never depart from Thee. I know my Heart is hard, dead, deceitful; Lord, give me a new Heart, a tender Heart, a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Heart, an humble, sincere Heart; an Heart for Thy self after Thine own Heart, that I may love Thee continually.</p>
               <p>Thus follow on the work the whole day together, go not off presently; but pray, and search, promise, and vow, and pray again; say, Lord, if there be yet any deceit, any secret evil, search, root it out, and lead me in the way Everlasting. I am now willing to be wholly Thine, always Thine, and then I am sure I am truly mine own. I know, this is hard work for one not us'd to ordinary fasting, and prayer, and trial. The Horse, not us'd to daily Riding and Exercise, is unfit presently for a Race. It's hard for such to work all the day, that do not work an hour or two daily before hand. But such is my urgent necessity, and present need, that I must now set to it without delay, and must do it to purpose, or as good not do it at all. The Lord help you to be sincere, faithful, and unwearied, in this blessed work, and it may be the best day you ever spent in your Lives, and you may have cause to bless God
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:94151:157"/> for it to all Eternity. What would Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands in Hell give for such an opportunity, if they had it, and it could be bought with Gold and Silver, or any pains and industry? I doubt not, but were it in my power to offer such terms to a dying Man, that cries, and begs for Life, O that God would spare him a little longer; as an extravagant young Man said on his Death-bed, could I Live but one year more, though but in Sackcloth and Ashes: Could I make any Proposals, I doubt not but I could make my own terms; as if God will spare you, will you promise me faithfully to spend an hour every morning and evening on your knees at prayer? will you read so many Chapters daily? will you spend one whole day every week, in fasting, prayer, and weeping? I doubt not, but many, most that are awaken'd and sensible, would answer, ay, with all my Heart, and be glad with such seasons, rather than with days of mirth and folly; rather than eating, drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and sinning. Well, why can you not be Wise, and willing, thus in time, before it is too late? I hope, all this will prevail on some, to set to this work presently and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily, if God bless it to your Souls, it will be so. I can but set it before you, if you will, you may still move on in your old course and ways. The Lord grant, if it be his blessed will, none of you that read these lines, may be foolish, desperate, and hardn'd to your own Destruction.</p>
               <pb n="297" facs="tcp:94151:157"/>
               <p>One such private, retir'd day, may be of more use to you, than all the publick Seasons and opportunities of Grace.</p>
               <p>Now you are alone; have time and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to meditate, and search, to look back on your Lives, to look into your Hearts; when you are in company, reading or praying, you must go along with what is in hand.</p>
               <p>But now you may sometimes read, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times pray, sometimes meditate; think of sin, till you feel its weight and burden, its guilt, sting, and burning; think of Gods love in Jesus Christ, till your Souls are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flam'd, and ravisht with love; and you have nothing to hinder you but your wicked Hearts, and that, I confess, is bad enough; as one said to a good Man that was troubl'd at the wickedness of the World, and said, he would live alone, and leave all wicked company; said the other, you must not then carry your Heart with you. However, you have but this one enemy to struggle with; and you may call in Gods help and assistence. Well, think once, and again, is all well? may it not be better? is there no hope, no help? shall I wilfully, and willingly, destroy my self thorow mine own neglect? Would I be thus cruel to my Friend, my Child; if one days fasting, and weeping, and searching, and praying, would save him? shall I say, rather let him perish Soul and Body to all
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:94151:158"/> Eternity, than I will thus spend a day on my knees, in pinching my Body, and denying my self the pleasures of this Life?</p>
               <p>What though a debaucht Drunkard said to his Physician,<note place="margin">Vale, lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> that told him, if he left not off drinking excessively, he would lose his sight; then farewel, dear eyes, rather than I will lose my cups. Thus many, cruel to their Bodies, grow fat, unwieldy, sickly, pain'd, have the dropsy, and yet not deny themselves meat and drink; if they are cruel to their Bodies, what hurt hath thy Soul done thee? wherein hath it so highly offended thee, that thou wilt destroy it to all Eternity, rather than deny thy self a little pleasure, ease, and sloth. What hath thy pamper'd, slothful, sinful flesh, deserv'd so well at thy hands, that it must have all thy time, care, and pains, and pleasure; and not afford thy self, one day, one week apart from all worldly mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters? Pity, some pity, for the Lords sake, for thine one sake, on that Body and Soul of thine, before it be too late. If nothing will prevail, now God sends me with this message of love to you; sad is that condition. <hi>Prov.</hi> 9, beg. Wisdom hath builded her House, killed her beasts, mingled her Wine, furnisht her Table, sent forth us Ministers to cry upon the highest places; whoso is simple, let him turn in hither, as for him that wanteth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, she saith to him, come eat of my bread, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> forsake the foolish and live. <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.20, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> She cryeth in the chief place
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:94151:158"/> of concourse, How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity; turn you at my reproof. Well, but sinners will not hear, turn, and live. Why then, <hi>v.</hi> 24, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> because I have called, and ye refused, ye have set at nought my counsel, I will also laugh at your cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, when your fear cometh as a desolation, and your destruction as a Whirl-wind; when distress and anguish cometh on you, as it will certainly at Death. <hi>v.</hi> 28. Then sinners may call, and I will not answer; they may seek me early, and earnestly, but shall not find me; their turning away shall slay them, and their prosperity destroy them: yet <hi>ver.</hi> last, Who so hearkeneth to me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Lord grant, that what I have written, and you have read, may not rise up in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against us at the last day, to condemn us, because of our neglecting so great Salvation.</hi>
